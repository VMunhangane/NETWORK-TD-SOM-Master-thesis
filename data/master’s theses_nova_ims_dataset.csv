This concept emerged to deal with the growing urbanization faced by the cities around the globe. Within problems brought by the urbanization, waste management is one of the hardest and most impactful. The collection stage of the waste management is the costliest and the route planning for the garbage trucks is a well-known hard problem. In this project, a genetic algorithm is proposed to deal with the waste collection routing problem using a heterogeneous fleet of trucks. As the population in the city is expected to grow over the years, the project adapts to the current state of the city, because it uses the concept of open data from the municipality to feed itself with the garbage collection information and generate its results. Multiple runs were performed to define its parameters. The algorithm was tested in the simplified real case of Campolide, in the municipality of Lisbon, and proved to be feasible for application on real-world scenarios relying only on actual data of the cities  waste collection."

It focuses on the distinctive applications of ESSPs and on the initiatives contributing to maximize its advantages. 
In the first part of the research, I have itemized all types of existing collaboration tools and classify them in different categories according to their capabilities, objectives and according to their faculty for promoting knowledge sharing. In the second part, and based on an exploratory case study at Cisco Systems, I have identified the main applications of an existing enterprise social software platform named Webex Social. 
By combining a qualitative and quantitative approach, as well as combining data collected from survey  results and from the analysis of the company  documents, I am expecting to maximize the outcome of this investigation and reduce the risk of bias. 
Although effects cannot be universalized based on one single case study, some utilization patterns have been underlined from the data collected and potential trends in managing knowledge have been observed. The results of the research have also enabled identifying most of the constraints experienced by the users of the firm  social software platform. 
Utterly, this research should provide a primary framework for firms planning to create or implement a social software platform and for firms willing to increase adoption levels and to promote the overall participation of users. It highlights the common traps that should be avoided by developers when designing a social software platform and the capabilities that it should inherently carry to support an effective knowledge management strategy."

Learning Machine (SLM) algorithm, a recently proposed neuroevolution method 
that searches over unimodal error landscapes in any supervised learning problem, 
where the error is measured as a distance to the known targets. SLM is compared with 
the topology-changing algorithm NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) 
and with a fixed-topology neuroevolution approach. Experiments are performed on a 
total of 6 real-world datasets of classification and regression tasks. The results show 
that the best SLM variants outperform the other neuroevolution approaches in terms 
of generalization achieved, while also being more efficient in learning the training data. 
Further comparisons show that the best SLM variants also outperform the common 
ANN backpropagation-based approach under different topologies. A combination of 
the SLM with a recently proposed semantic stopping criterion also shows that it is 
possible to evolve competitive neural networks in a few seconds on the vast majority 
of the datasets considered."

As so,
institutions in general, and those within the financial sector in particular, started to pay more attention
to it, in addition to the attention they were already paying to other long-standing and well-known
types of risk, namely, those of market and credit risk. One of the many tools used by financial
institutions to prevent against operational risk concerns the way these can develop analytical
processes that strengthen two of their biggest actives: on the one side, the intensification of computer
power at a lower cost, and, on the other side, the increasingly growing quantity of data that is produced
and stored. This way, data is unquestionably seen as the most plentiful resource in organisations.
However, it is the capacity to analyse data, and to extract information that carries some knowledge,
that is the driving force responsible for the productivity growth, innovation and competitive
advantages of organisations. This necessity initiated the development of the Knowledge Discovery on
Databases (KDD) process, and its most complex analytical component, Data Mining. The latter has its
origins in various subjects, such as statistics, artificial intelligence, or computer science. Data Mining
has gained major relevance in the last two decades, both academically and at the organisational level,
having this mainly to do with: (i) how it allows to explore and analyse large quantities of data; (ii)
through the analysis, how it allows to uncover hidden relationships and similarity patterns amongst
data; (iii) how it allows the analyst to withdraw conclusions about these relationships and patterns,
achieving new predictive knowledge capable of increasing business activities and, as a consequence,
displaying more advantages over the competition. When it comes to the banking sector, these tools
allow for a better performance analysis of the reality and help in decision-making processes, for
instance, whether a credit granting should be or should not be attributed/permitted. In other words,
due to its capacity to analyse both past and present, Data Mining is able to find the basis that allow to
predict the future. "

This study further tests the moderating influence based on gender, investigating the changes in the healthy eating behavior of male and female participants after randomly confronted with a picture of a normal versus an obese individual that created the product. This effect of the creator  body type and gender on healthy food consumption is justified by the gender differences in terms of physical self-perception and social comparison. In two studies we test our hypothesis, evaluating the perception of healthiness and tastiness in two different sets of food products commonly perceived as healthy and unhealthy (pilot study) and the effect of creator  body type and gender on healthy food consumption (study 1).

algorithms, seeing as they are designed to handle balanced class distributions and perform poorly 
when applied to problems of the imbalanced nature. Many methods have been developed to address 
this specific problem but the more general approach to achieve a balanced class distribution is data 
level modification, instead of algorithm modifications. Although class imbalances are responsible for 
significant losses of performance in standard classifiers in many different types of problems, another 
aspect that is important to consider is the small disjuncts problem. Therefore, it is important to 
consider and understand solutions that not only take into the account the between-class imbalance 
(the imbalance occurring between the two classes) but also the within-class imbalance (the imbalance 
occurring between the sub-clusters of each class) and to oversample the dataset by rectifying these 
two types of imbalances simultaneously. It has been shown that cluster-based oversampling is a robust 
solution that takes into consideration these two problems. This work sets out to study the effect and 
impact combining different existing oversampling methods with a clustering-based approach. 
Empirical results of extensive experiments show that the combinations of different oversampling 
techniques with the clustering algorithm k-means   K-Means Oversampling - improves upon

Often, the challenge that many decision-makers face is to determine which data and how much to collect, and what needs to be kept in their data storage. The challenge is to preserve enough information to inform decisions but doing so without overly high costs of storage and data processing cost. In this thesis, this challenge is studied in the context of a collection of mobile signaling data for studying tourists  behavioral patterns. Given the number of mobile phones in use, and frequency of their interaction with network infrastructure and location reporting, mobile data sets represent a rich source of information for mobility studies. The objective of this research is to analyze to what extent can individual trajectories be reconstructed if only a fraction of the original location data is preserved, providing insights about the tradeoff between the volume of data available and the accuracy of reconstructed paths. To achieve this, a signaling data of 277,093 anonymized foreign travelers is sampled with different sampling rates, and the full trajectories are reconstructed, using the last seen, linear, and cubic interpolations completion methods. The results of the comparison are discussed from the perspective of data management and implications on the research, especially the results of research with lower time-density mobile phone data."

The texts shared on social networks and the interactions resulting from all virtual activities have been gaining a great impact on the daily life of society and in the economic and financial sphere, social networks have been the subject of several studies, particularly in terms of forecasting and description of the stock market (Zhang, Fuehres, & Gloor, 2011) (Bollen, Mao & Zheng, 2010). In this investigation, we realized whether the sentiment of Twitter, a social network for microblogging, is directly related to the stock market, thus wanting to understand the impact of social networks on the financial market. So we tried to relate two dimensions, social and financial, in order to understand how we can use the values ?? of one to predict the other. It is an especially interesting topic for companies and investors as they try to understand if what is said about a certain company on Twitter can be related to the market value of that company. We used two sentiment analysis techniques, one of lexical word comparison and the other of machine learning, to understand which of the two had better accuracy in classifying tweets into three attributes, positive, negative or neutral. The machine learning model was the chosen model and we related these data with stock market data using a Granger causality test. We found that for certain companies there is a relationship between the two variables, Twitter sentiment and change in stock position between two periods of time in the stock market, the latter variable being dependent on the temporal dimension in which we group our Twitter sentiment. This study thus intended to continue the work developed by Bollen, Mao and Zheng (2010) who found that a dimension of feeling (calm) can be used to predict the direction of stock market actions, despite having rejected that general sentiment ( positive, negative, or neutral) did not have a global relationship with the stock market. In their work, they compared the sentiment of all the tweets from a certain period without exclusion with the general index of stocks in the market, while the methodology adopted in this investigation was carried out by company and we were only interested in tweets that related to that specific company. With this difference, we obtained different results and certain companies showed that there was a relationship between various combinations, especially for technology companies. iv We tested the Twitter sentiment grouping in 3 minutes, 1 hour and 1 day, with certain companies only showing relationship when we increased our time dimension. This leads us to believe that the general feeling of the company, and if it is a technology company, is linked to the stock market, this relationship being conditioned to the temporal dimension that we may be analyzing."

organizations. The main objective of this project was to understand the most efficient way to
use interactivity in different groups of individuals, experts and novices, and to discover the
main differences between these two groups. This was achieved through the creation of a
prototype with several interactive visualizations, where in each of them different
visualizations and interaction techniques were used. After the creation of the prototype, the
next step was the validation of each one of them to reach conclusions on what are the most
effective means to improve visual analysis and communication, in different groups of
individuals. The development of the prototype was done using the R software, and most
specifically the Shiny package. This study contributed with a methodology to evaluate the
differences between experts and novices, using the visualization prototype that was validated
with 6 quantitative and qualitative metrics. Using an ANOVA single factor test it was
possible to conclude that regarding the quantitative measures no statistically significant
differences were found. However, regarding the qualitative measures the only measure that
had statistically significant differences between both groups was the engagement measure.
This means that this is the only metric where results can be improved in order to close the gap
between the group of experts and novices. Regarding the visualizations, both groups agreed
that the best visualizations were the heatmap and the bar chart and the worst visualizations
were the choropleth map and the stacked bar chart. Nevertheless, there were differences
between how the different groups interacted with the components. For example, the select box
was a better option for the novice  group, while the radio box was the best for the expert 
group. The tooltips and the slider are adequate for both types of individuals. It was also
proved that the Shiny package is a tool that is capable of creating effective interactive
visualizations for different types of individuals, since that on average the participants obtained
great results using qualitative or quantitative measures. The results of this study will allow
organizations to efficiently adapt their visualizations to different types of audiences."

First, it addresses a gap in the SaaS adoption literature by studying the internal perception of the technical features of SaaS and external coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures faced by an organization. Second, it empirically tests many of the propositions of PVT and INT in the SaaS context, thereby helping to determine how the theory operates in practice.

positive valence influences it the least.
The analysis of WOM antecedents and, afterwards, of the individual characteristics of

verified that the values for each of this latent factors differ significantly among different

by Islamist militants  belonging to al-Shabaab terrorist organization on Nairobi  
Westgate shopping mall in September 2013, tourist forecast has gone down sharply 
with an average of 20% fall in tourists  arrivals which is likely to have an impact on 
the tourism sector in Kenya. Even before the deadly attack on Westgate, the most 
lethal attack by Islamist terrorists in 15 years in Kenya, the government through the 
Kenya tourist board had announced that in 2013 tourist arrivals were down by 12%, 
at 495,978, according to an October 2013 report by Bloomberg. Tourism revenues 
were also down by 7.4%, over FY12/13 (July-June) to reach KES96.24bn, according 
to a September 2013 report on the local Capital FM website. 
Beyond 2013, much will depend on how quickly the Kenya tourist board can regain 
control of the situation. The Kenyan government believes that the Westgate mall 
attack was a 'one-off' incident, with a low probability of a similar event happening 
again over the short term period. Germany, United States, United Kingdom, 
Australia, Italy, France and Canada continue to be the key source market however; 
the Kenya tourist board can make continued growth stronger from new emerging 
markets in order to increase new arrivals into the country. 
The marketing plan outlines the objectives to be implemented and provides the 
implementation strategy, activity plans, monitoring and evaluation plans, financial 
requirements projections and proposes a new structure of experiential marketing. A 
number of regional forces are identified that will impact tourism into the country 
including global, social and economic forces, emerging trends in visitor motivations 
and behavior, emerging forces in experiential marketing. 
A major component of the strategy identifies target markets for Kenya to 
commensurate with the level of resources that will be available for marketing and 
promotion, in keeping with the forces and trends identified and the nature of the 
Kenya tourism environment. The agreed upon target market segments are: 
generic/mass travel, experiential travel, creative travel, adventure seeking travel, 
senior/extended/long stay travel, and business related travel. The strategy phases the 
development of the target markets over the years of the marketing strategies in order 
to yield the best opportunity for results.

experiences Kenya offers in tourism. The strategy  experience development process 
will continue to develop within the context of the products identified which will be 
promoted regionally: culture/heritage, nature, community-based. Each county in the 
country has a significant number of attractions and experiences and the challenge of 
the country is to bring these together in a creative and innovative way in order to 
encourage tourists to visit more than one county in Kenya."

The methodology was divided into a provider-centered and a patient-centered approach, being characterized as a mixed-methods research as qualitative and quantitative data collection procedures were followed. Results point out that EHR portals are considered by providers as crucial in the establishment of a digital relationship with patients, but efforts still need to be carried out for the users to adhere to these technologies. Also, the portals available in Portugal are heterogeneous in terms of functionalities offered, greatly differing in terms of number of functionalities. Patients view some functionalities of EHR portals more important than others and half of them are users of the portal developed by the public provider. The statistically determinants of adoption of EHR portals were verified.

between brands and users, brand and endorsers has been analyzed from several different 
perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how these three elements co-create 
online the brand personality of Nike. Social networks built through user-generated content, and 
created around strings of hashtags, are analyzed using Twitter. 
Through social network analysis (SNA), this dissertation first analyzes and visualizes a network 
of Nike (a brand), and three of its ambassadors, Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James and Serena 
Williams. The second step is the performance of a semantic analysis to determine the positive 
or negative influence of the ambassadors  conversations content, to determine the sentiment 
impact on Nike  personality. This study uses a SNA software called NodeXL. 
The selected research queries are built with just one hashtag. The results show that boolean 
research queries are very small and generate few or no conversations. Nike and Cristiano 
networks are the ones with most vertices (users). Of these two networks, Cristiano  network 
has the most unique edges (relationships). In terms of distribution by groups, Nike is the network 
that has more groups, 5 of these groups have more than 100 vertices. Serena's network has only 
54 groups, all with less than 100 vertices. Some occurrences in Cristiano's network show the 
presence of negative feelings associated with Nike. In LeBron  network, there are only positive 
associations to the brand. Serena  network does not include any reference to Nike and uses 
more positive than negative words. 
The development of this dissertation transmits the diversity and complexity in analyzing social 
networks and reaching concrete conclusions. The conversations, the constitution of the 
networks, the format of the groups, all have their peculiarities. A network does not repeat itself, 
it changes with each Tweet, Mentions, Retweet, etc. The development of programs that allow 
the analysis and visualization of social networks is vital for today, as well as the ability to analyze and understand this new reality. This study contributes to knowledge and practice by 
demonstrating the variety and complexity of social network analysis need to pursue to secure a 
complete understanding of the role of these conversations have on the personality of a brand."

Naturally, this evolution has had a huge impact on the growth of online commerce. Virtually all industries have adopted online commerce, giving consumers the possibility to buy their products/services online, through computers or smartphones, without having physically to go to a store. 
The fashion industry is no exception and increasingly invests in e-commerce to optimize the consumer experience. Brands have the ability to offer services that serve as an extension of the communication carried out in physical stores, therefore complementing the consumer's experience so that it becomes more real and satisfying. This type of commerce also allows the brands to better understand the customer needs and the major market trends, providing an increasingly satisfying consumer experience. 
This dissertation intends to analyse the behaviours and relationships underlying online shopping by understanding what drives consumers to buy online instead of going to a store. I chose the Zara brand as the object of my study, not only because it is a brand with a lot of notoriety in the world market, but also because it has an extremely important position and relevance in the Portuguese market. 
The conclusions and results of this study demonstrate that the tendency is towards online shopping. Through the quantitative analysis of the results obtained, it is possible to verify that Covid19 has increased the online purchases, however people are not very afraid of going shopping in person. They seem to choose the online option due to its comfort and efficiency. It is also discussed the importance of creating bonds between consumers and the brands since these relationships are later translated into profitability and growth for the companies."

Several stores and restaurants closed, and a lot of flights were cancelled. Social Media Influencers, that provide their services through social media platforms, found themselves also stuck at home. Firstly, there is an impact in influencers  lives because some paid partnerships are on hold, cancelled, few remained. But, at what cost? Is it really the moment to advertise a makeup product? Should they use their influencing powers to encourage their followers to stay at home? Should they encourage their communities to go to a supermarket buy a new shampoo? Considering this context, the present project considers relevant to explore types of contents shares by Social Media Influencers on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic in Portugal (2ndMarch 2020), brands that continued paid partnerships and reactions of consumers to said content. To reach this purpose, four Portuguese Social Media Influencers from Instagram were chosen two Celebrities and two Digital Native Influencers, with an average of 764 thousand followers. From these four people and all content shared between 19th Marchand 16th May 2020 two types of posts were selected, with over 1,3 thousand comments and over 176 thousand likes, with main guidelines: Advertisement (Content Type 1) and Entertainment (Content Type 2). These posts were selected based on Interaction Rate and Total Amount of Comments. For the analysis itself, there was a first step of comments  extraction, after all comments were aggregated (N=1355), their polarity was categorized through Meaning Cloud. Sentiment analysis was performed through Fighting Without Fighting, a Python-based program that generates statistical analysis and data visualization based on text. Through the results, it was possible to conclude that the audience of these four Social Media Influencers had a predominantly more positive reaction to Content Type 1 as for Content Type 2. However, content with the goal of entertain (entertainment) registered a more positive reaction when compared to the reaction of content promoting a product (advertisement)."

Online reviews provide consumers with clues about the quality of the products that they want to buy. Consumers rely on clues, such as, review helpfulness votes and rating to infer product quality. In this study, we perform a Text Clustering and a Text Categorization analysis to uncover the review characteristics and to predict the review rating, helpfulness votes and the product price, based on review corpus. We use a dataset with 72 878 reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on Amazon.com to perform this analysis. The main goal of this research is to understand the impact of review valence, rating and type on helpfulness votes on Amazon, for unlocked mobile phones. This research aims, also to understand the impact of price on customer satisfaction and the relationship between customer satisfaction and ratings. 
Our results suggest that positive reviews that emphasize the feature level quality of the products receive more helpful votes than the positive reviews that contain mainly subjective expressions or negative reviews. Another important finding of this research is on the influence of the price of the product. The phones with high price tend to receive more positive reviews and more helpful votes. These findings have important managerial and theoretical implications. To best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to analyze the effect of the combination of valence, rating and subjectivity of the review text on helpful votes."

Study Objectives: The main objective of this study will be to estimate Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS), and estimate the cost-effectiveness of Nivolumab when compared to Pembrolizumab in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, from the perspective of a private health institution. Patients and Methods: The study included patients with recurrent NSCLC that started treatment between January 2015 and November 2020. PFS and OS will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival plots and a log-rank analysis will be used to compare the two groups. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis will be expressed using Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Clinical parameters will be extracted from the private institution  electronic medical records and administrative datasets, economic and quality of life parameters will be drawn from the literature. A total of 80 patients with recurrent NSCLC treated with either Pembrolizumab or Nivolumab were identified. Results: PFS and OS were not significantly higher between the groups. There were no new identified safety signals and both therapies had a similar safety profile. In this setting, it seems that Pembrolizumab is not cost-effective when compared to Nivolumab, although there must be cautions when interpreting the results, because we have a small sample and a single center, which could lead to a bias. Regarding effectiveness either drug can be used according to the patient  or physician  choice."

The world economy suffered a major setback and Governments and Central Banks had to provide actions to regain the financial strength they once had. A quick response was demanded in order to reverse this tsunami of downfalls that jeopardized the economical actors. This paper intends to analyse the effects of negative interest rates plus a specific policy adopted by the European Central Bank (ECB), namely the Negative Interest Rates Policy (NIRP), on banks  profitability in Portugal. We identified and analysed the five main channels by which NIRP impacts on banks  profitability, namely the Interest Rate Channel, the Credit Channel, the Portfolio Channel, the Reflation Channel and the Exchange Rate Channel. We used Multiple Linear Regression models combined with a Stepwise Regression to identify the most significant variables in explaining bank's profitability and performance. This method is commonly used in similar related studies. We considered multiple explanatory variables, including ECB key interest rates (deposit and facility rates), Interbank Money Market Interest Rates, Bank Specific covariates (e.g., Cost-to-Income ratio, Loan-to-Deposit ratio) and macroeconomic variables (e.g., real GDP Growth, unemployment rate). We use publicly available data for 35 different banks from 2010 to 2017 provided by Portuguese Banking Association (AssociaÁ?o Portuguesa de Bancos, APB), Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal, BdP), ECB and European Money Markets Institute (EMMI). During this period Portuguese banks made some changes in their business strategies, increasing the focus on servicing fees and commissions and higher returns from portfolio management. After executing the models and analysing the results, we can conclude that when ECB decided to use NIRP, as a mean to recover the European economy, the channels that most affected Portuguese bank  profitability, were the Interest Rate Channel, the Credit Channel and the Portfolio Channel."

purpose of gaining competitive advantage is rising, specially in retail, an extremely competitive 
sector that requires an even bigger advantage. Additionally, food loss, beyond representing a huge 
waste of resources, can also be considered a major issue to the retail sector due to the financial 
losses originated from it. Thus, I proposed to help Pingo Doce, a well-known Portuguese retail 
company, to solve their food loss issue which, despite being the major cause of a huge drop in the 
company  profits, has never been solved till this day. 
Therefore, this project focuses on the development of a classification algorithm that will allow to 
predict future significant losses in several fruits sold in certain Pingo Doce stores. To do so I applied a 
Decision Tree algorithm that, due to its representation in the form of if-then rules, will help to 
identify the main features that lead to a higher number of losses, namely the period of the year and 
the category to which each fruit belongs, among others. 
The dataset provided by the company contains variables that measure the quantity and value of 
sales, stocks, identified and unidentified losses, over a one-year period, and regarding 81 different 
fruits and 20 stores from all over the country. Additionally, I created new variables such as the 
criminality rate of the municipality and the climate class of each store, as well as the seasons and the 
day of the week in which each observation occurred. All these variables allowed me to create four 
different datasets that originated four different Classification Trees. 
The results show that, using a dataset with no information regarding stocks and sales, containing 
only variables that describe the characteristics of the stores, products and periods of time, as well as 
the value of product sold per unit of measurement, i.e. the price per unit of measurement of each 
fruit, it is possible to create a Decision Tree that reaches an accuracy of 74% and correctly predicts 
82% of the observations that represent significant losses. 
The algorithm obtained allowed to identify the variables that are more prone to originate significant 
losses, namely: the day of the week, the fruit  category, the season of the year, the position of that 
week in the respective month and the price at which the product is being sold."

be provided by multiple SIM and used at various strategic levels, though there is no
rule regarding the information output system, or strategic layer in which it is
employed. The Commerce Segment, essentially formed by supermarket companies,
uses Geomarketing in about 60% of the researched activities, whereas the Education
Segment uses Geomarketing at approximately 49%. Both segments identified several
advantages in practicing Geomarketing: crossing-referencing numerous variables
simultaneously, visualizing information on maps and the intuitive nature of GIS
software graphical interfaces, to name a few. All this enables data pattern
identification that otherwise wouldn t be easily grasped, greater speed and ease in
data analysis, better information perception, and the possibility of creating new
indicators, among others. These advantages mean a faster and more assertive
decision-making."

As the increasing alienation of citizens from politics endangers democracy and welfare, governments, practitioners and researchers look for innovative means to engage citizens in policy matters. One of the measures intended to overcome the so-called democratic deficit is the promotion of civic participation. Digital media proliferation offers a set of novel characteristics related to interactivity, ubiquitous connectivity, social networking and inclusiveness that enable new forms of societal-wide collaboration with a potential impact on leveraging participative democracy. 
Following this trend, e-Participation is an emerging research area that consists in the use of Information and Communication Technologies to mediate and transform the relations among citizens and governments towards increasing citizens participation in public decision-making. However, despite the widespread efforts to implement e-Participation through research programs, new technologies and projects, exhaustive studies on the achieved outcomes reveal that it has not yet been successfully incorporated in institutional politics. Given the problems underlying e-Participation implementation, the present research suggested that, rather than project-oriented efforts, the cornerstone for successfully implementing e-Participation in public institutions as a sustainable added-value activity is a systematic organisational planning, embodying the principles of open-governance and open-engagement. 
It further suggested that BPM, as a management discipline, can act as a catalyst to enable the desired transformations towards value creation throughout the policy-making cycle, including political, organisational and, ultimately, citizen value. Following these findings, the primary objective of this research was to provide an instrumental model to foster e-Participation sustainability across Government and Public Administration towards a participatory, inclusive, collaborative and deliberative democracy. 
The developed artefact, consisting in an e-Participation Organisational Semantic Model (ePOSM) underpinned by a BPM-steered approach, introduces this vision. This approach to e-Participation was modelled through a semi-formal lightweight ontology stack structured in four sub-ontologies, namely e-Participation Strategy, Organisational Units, Functions and Roles. The ePOSM facilitates e-Participation sustainability by:
i.	Promoting a common and cross-functional understanding of the concepts underlying e-Participation implementation and of their articulation that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical users;
ii.	Providing an organisational model which allows a centralised and consistent roll-out of strategy-driven e-Participation initiatives, supported by operational units dedicated to the execution of transformation projects and participatory processes;
iii.	Providing a standardised organisational structure, goals, functions and roles related to e-Participation processes that enhances process-level interoperability among government agencies; 
iv.	Providing a representation usable in software development for business processes  automation, which allows advanced querying using a reasoner or inference engine to retrieve concrete and specific information about the e-Participation processes in place. An evaluation of the achieved outcomes, as well a comparative analysis with existent models, suggested that this innovative approach tackling the organisational planning dimension can constitute a stepping stone to harness e-Participation value."

These reviews were extracted from the sector  most impacted period during the pandemic   from the date where the first travel restrictions were imposed until the date where they began to be lifted again (from March to May, 2020), which consequently led to a greater number of reviews made. A total of 885 reviews were collected and analysed with the help of the Python-based sentiment analysis tool VADER. Results showed a very negative trend, which was mainly caused by issues related to refunds policies and process, confirming the reported pandemic impact on this sector. Low-cost airlines revealed a lower customer satisfaction rate when compared to traditional ones, while most of the posts were related to Loyalty/Competitiveness, which affected the brands  overall equity. This study contributes to the existing knowledge as there are still few studies addressing the coronavirus impact on airlines. It focuses on the customers  satisfaction aspect, which has no precedent studies made.

The project starts with the definition of the problem, objectives and methodology. It is then followed 
by the literature review, which consists of a thorough research to identify best practices and previous 
works in the literature that dealt with similar problems. The research focuses on three main topics: 
Supply Chain Management, Internet Retail Industry and Business Intelligence. 
A conceptual model is then developed, which consists of four main steps: definition of the overall 
requirements, metrics, data mart model and dashboards. For the data mart model, it is important to 
identify the business process, the appropriate granularity and respective dimensions and fact tables. 
It is then followed by a case study, which consists in the implementation of the model to solve

system and the cost of healthcare (for instance, treatments and medication), specifically for 
cardiovascular diseases treatment, it has become extremely important the provision of quality services 
by making use of preventive medicine, whose focus is identifying the disease risk, and then, applying 
the right action in case of early signs. Therefore, by resorting to DM (Data Mining) and its techniques, 
there is the ability to uncover patterns and relationships amongst the objects in healthcare data, giving 
the potential to use it more efficiently, and to produce business intelligence and extract knowledge 
that will be crucial for future answers about possible diseases and treatments on patients. Nowadays, 
the concept of DM is already applied in medical information systems for clinical purposes such as 
diagnosis and treatments, that by making use of predictive models can diagnose some group of 
diseases, in this case, heart attacks. 
The focus of this project consists on applying machine learning techniques to develop a predictive 
model based on a real dataset, in order to detect through the analysis of patient  data whether a 
person can have a heart attack or not. At the end, the best model is found by comparing the different 
algorithms used and assessing its results, and then, selecting the one with the best measures. 
The correct identification of early cardiovascular problems signs through the analysis of patient data 
can lead to the possible prevention of heart attacks, to the consequent reduction of complications and 
secondary effects that the disease may bring, and most importantly, to the decrease on the number 
of deaths in the future. Making use of Data Mining and analytics in healthcare will allow the analysis 
of high volumes of data, the development of new predictive models, and the understanding of the 
factors and variables that have the most influence and contribution for this disease, which people 
should pay attention. Hence, this practical approach is an example of how predictive analytics can have 
an important impact in the healthcare sector: through the collection of patient  data, models learn 
from it so that in the future they can predict new unknown cases of heart attacks with better 
accuracies. In this way, it contributes to the creation of new models, to the tracking of patient  health 
data, to the improvement of medical decisions, to efficient and faster responses, and to the wellbeing 
of the population that can be improved if diseases like this can be predicted and avoided. To conclude, this project aims to present and show how Data Mining techniques are applied in

develop brand awareness and positively influences brand associations and perceived
quality. On the other hand, the skepticism on advertising has no influence on the brand
value dimensions. Since the study has focused on low involvement brands, it may not
exist obligation in product evaluation from the consumer's side and this is the reason
why there is no demonstration of any skepticism regarding the advertising.
Research also shows that monetary and non-monetary promotions have different
impacts on the brand equity. Frequent monetary promotions negatively influence brand
equity, whilst monetary promotions do not have any effect on this concept. Finally, is
also possible to conclude that for the construction of a strong brand equity is necessary
to understand the casual linkages that exist amongst its different dimensions."

The correlation between artist, song genre and other audio features was also analyzed. Furthermore, the classification performance of different machine learning algorithms was evaluated and compared, e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors. 
We found that Support Vector Machines attained the highest performance when using either only Audio features or a combination of Audio Features and Genre. Namely, an F-measure of 0.46 and 0.45 was achieved, respectively. We concluded that the Artist variable was not impactful to the emotion of the songs. 
Therefore, by using Support Vector Machines with the combination of Audio and Genre variables, we analyzed the results and created a dashboard to visualize the incorrectly classified songs.

These promotions cause a significant decrease in profit margin hence forcing a stronger focus on logistic processes efficiency. Forced to make use of stochastic tools in order to better allocate resources for the future events, those responsible for assortment strategy frequently choose time series based algorithms and simple extrapolation of historical data, under the assumption that these events can be considered continuous, smooth and possibly periodic. While computationally light, these algorithms are subject to greater uncertainty due to the simplistic approach. Meanwhile, the explosive growth of information and availability of data brought by improved automatic collection systems allow new and more complex approaches.These tackle the high dimensionality problem, focused on retrieving knowledge from potentially rich sources of information. The work developed in this thesis aims to develop a comprehensive and scalable solution using machine learning algorithms to forecast daily sales of articles in a retail store, under the influence of discounts, as to support logistic storage allocation operations. This is done with the purpose of decreasing costs related to stock warehousing while simultaneously decreasing stock-outs as they directly influence client satisfaction with the brand. The development of a successful automatic modelling system would simultaneously allow retailers to optimize their promotional schedules based on the expected results of different simulations. Using real data from one of the biggest retailers in Portugal, this project  falls into the definition of Big Data due to extensive historical databases which cannot be simultaneously processed. The presence of discrepancies between registered stock and physical availability - Phantom stock - will be considered as well as relevant external events which affect the sales."

After collecting and transforming data from Sports-Reference.com, the experimental part consists of preprocess the data, evaluate the features to consider in the models and train the data. In this study, based on tournament data over the last 20 years, Machine Learning algorithms like Decision Trees Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier and others were applied to measure the accuracy of the predictions and to be compared with some benchmarks. 
Despite of the most important variables seemed to be those related to seeds, shooting and the number of participations in the tournament, it was not possible to define exactly which ones should be used in the modeling and all ended up being used. 
Regarding the results, when training the entire dataset, the accuracy ranges from 65 to 70%, where Support Vector Classification yields the best results. When compared with picking the highest seed, these results are slightly lower. On the other hand, when predicting the Tournament of 2017, the Support Vector Classification and the Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier reach 85 and 79% of accuracy, respectively. In this sense, they surpass the previous benchmark and the most respected websites and statistics in the field.

These delays associated with other factors can cause costs, both quantitative and qualitative. Consequently, there is a need to anticipate and mitigate the existence of airborne delays that can help airlines and airports improving their performance or even take some consumer-oriented measures that can undo or attenuate the effect that these delays have on their passengers. This study has as primary objective to predict the occurrence of arrival delays of the international airport of Hartsfield-Jackson. It was possible by building a predictive model, applying several Data Mining techniques. With these applications, it was possible to show the variables, among the proposals, that most contributed to the existence of the delay. In this work, the Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD) methodology was followed. Phases such as data collection; sampling techniques (SMOTE and Undersampling); Data partitioning in training and testing; Pre-processing (missing data and outliers) and data transformation (data normalization and attribute selection); And, finally the definition of models to be trained (Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Multilayer Perceptron), as well as the evaluation of the performance of the models through varied metrics, were used. After testing different approaches, it was concluded that the best model is achieved with the variables related to departure, using the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm and applying SMOTE to deal with unbalanced data, removing outliers and selecting ten variables using GainRatio. On the other hand, when the variables with information of the departure are excluded, the algorithm that performs best is also the Multilayer Perceptron using the SMOTE technique but, this time, including the outliers and with fifteen variables selected again by the GainRatio. On both hypotheses, the explanatory variables that most contributed to the existence of the delay in arrivals were related to the weather, the airplane characteristics and the propagation of the delay. Our results for the Random Forests algorithm shown better performance, regarding accuracy, compared to other authors (Belcastro et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2016). Contrary, for the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm, was presented a lower accuracy compared to another equivalent study (Y. J. Kim et al., 2016)."

However, although the game of basketball is changing, a gain in efficiency is not being observed in jump shooting since the percentages of 3pt shots made in the NBA are not increasing as it would be expected from the increase in 3pt shot attempts. 
The purpose of this study was thus to analyse and make recommendations concerning the use of current technology for tracking shooting performance, as well as the use of new sensors. In order to do so, the main factors behind shooting success were taken into account, to guarantee that the recommendations were as well-founded as possible.

These interdependent networks account for the different sort of social ties individuals maintain per layer. In each layer individuals participate in N-Player Public Goods Games where benefits collected increase with amounts invested. It is, however, tempting to be a free-rider, i.e., to take advantage of the common pool without contributing to it, a situation from which a social dilemma results. This thesis offers new insights on how cooperation dynamics is shaped by multiple layers of social interactions and diversity of contributions invested per game. To this end, we resort to Evolutionary Game Theory and Network Science to provide a convenient framework to address the most important prototypical social conflicts and/or dilemmas in large networked populations. In particular, we propose a novel mean-field approach capable of tracking the self-organization of Cooperators when co-evolving with Defectors in a multilayer environment. We show that the emerging collective dynamics, which depends (i) on the underlying layer networks of interactions and (ii) on the criteria to share a finite investment across all games, often does not bear any resemblance with the local processes supporting them. Our findings suggest that, whenever individual investments are distributed among games or layers, resilience of cooperation against free-riders increases with the number of layers, and that cooperation emerges from a non-trivial organization of cooperation across the layers. In opposition, under constant, non-distributed investments, the level of cooperation shows little sensibility to variations in the number of layers. These findings put in evidence the importance of asymmetric contributions across games and social contexts in the emergence of human cooperation."

This project work proposing a strategy for using RPA - often referred to as bot - in the shared
accounting and finance services of a reference company, called XP, quoted on the stock exchange, in
the SAP Resource Planning (ERP) software, through the UiPath RPA tool, and to identify the excellent
opportunities, benefits and challenges, and the steps required to implement an RPA tool.
The investigation approach considers the following phases: definition of the process to be
automated, the definition of the implementation strategy, development and implementation of the
solution and subsequent validation and analysis of benefits.
To measure the benefits resulting from implementing the RPA, the following indicators were
collected: Total time that an employee engages to perform the tasks that the bot will replace, the
total time that the bot takes to perform automated tasks, and the percentage that results in failures
and errors by the bot.
Questionnaires were carried out to 17 professionals from the shared accounting and finance
services of the XP Company to gain insights into the automation of the process of this project and the
objectives this work proposes.
Most respondents characterize the automated task as repetitive, monotonous, and simple. The
benefits of automation are notable, allowing for a 66% reduction in task execution time. As for the
main impacts expected for the organizational department, they are: freeing up resources from
routine and monotonous tasks for tasks with greater added value, systematization and process
coherence.
It was possible to identify good processes that can be developed through RPA. The
departments with the most considerable potential for automation are accounts payable, treasury
and salary processing, there are potential and openness for future automation both in accounting
and finance and in other departments.
The key challenge of implementing RPA is technological, hence the need for the involvement
of IT teams and process reengineering.
Regarding the limitations, the literature currently available on RPA is exceedingly scarce, and
this study is limited to a unique process.
This RPA project served to demonstrate its technical feasibility. However, the company's
decision to proceed with RPA development projects depends on other factors, including financial
viability, so it is recommended that in future works, in addition, to extend the scope to other
processes, a Business Case is created."

This study intends to predict the profitability of a film through the elaboration of a predictive model, which uses several Data Mining methodologies -neural networks, decision trees and regressions to obtain the best preview of box office revenues. This analysis was carried out using historical data related to the most significant variables for viewers when deciding to view them, selected according to their value and importance to the model. It was then possible to gather a relevant set of information and cinematographic characteristics that allowed, a posteriori, the analysis and forecast of revenues from films not yet classified. In this model, three distinct approaches of the dependent variable (interval, binary and multi-class) were used, with the aim of studying the difference and predictive influence that each one has on the investigation results. To determine which prediction was statistically more correct, different metrics were also used: classification error, ROC index and F-measure for models that used the discrete dependent variable and the mean square error and maximum absolute error for the continuous variable. It was possible to conclude, after this study, that the best predictive results were obtained through neural networks and that this methodology was much superior in relation to other approaches. It was also found in relation to the distinction representing the dependent variable, that the multi-class model had a much higher error rate than the others, which is justified by the increased difficulty in accurately predicting in nine different classes."

Google, Apple, or more recently Airbnb and Uber are companies with tremendous impact in worldwide economy, social interactions and government. Over the past decade, both in the US and Europe, there has been an exponential growth in start-up formation. Thus, it seems a relevant challenge understanding what makes this type of high-risk ventures successful and as such, attractive to investors and entrepreneurs. Success for a start-up is defined here as the event that gives a large sum of money to the company  founders, investors and early employees, specifically through a process of M&A (Merger and Acquisition) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering). The ability to predict success is an invaluable competitive advantage for venture capitals on the hunt for investments since first-rate targets are those who have the potential for growing rapidly soon, which ultimately, allows investors to be one step ahead of competition. 
We explored the world  largest structured database for start-ups   provided by the website CrunchBase.com, with the objective of building a predictive model, through supervised learning, to accurately classify which start-ups are successful and which aren t. Most of the studies regarding the prediction of processes of M&A or an alternative definition of a company  success tend to focus on traditional management metrics provided by financial reports and thus using a low number of observations compared with the present study. As technologies of information evolve it became possible to achieve highly reliable results in data analysis by manipulating it with complex machine learning algorithms or data mining techniques to define features and characterize robust models. 
Further developments on previous studies such as the development of new features and a new definition for the target variable were applied. Using Random Forests on our dataset, a general model (as including all categorical features) achieved a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 94%, which is the highest recorded with this data source, and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 8%. The author also generated models per each category of a company to provide results comparable with previous studies the values achieved ranged between 61% and 96% compared with 44% and 80%. As a novelty, models for each of the five geographical regions selected (all from USA) are provided, with TPRs ranging between 90% and 96%. The new features, focused on the impact of venture capital in a company, proved pivotal to the overall performance of the models by being some of the most important to the final models showing the critical importance this type of investment has on these ventures."

Association) regarding the cutoff value of fasting glycaemia and HbA1c. Also, in the prediabetes class,
there are individuals who already show diabetes complications, others will progress, and those who

insufficient, not only for diagnosis, but also to identify the risk of progression of each individual. T2D
has a multifactorial and complex etiology. Based on actual criteria, we may be grouping individuals
with different phenotypes under the same diagnostic group. Applying equal approach to the
different phenotypes may contribute to the inefficacy of prevention, diagnosis and therapy, which
translates into the socioeconomic burden that T2D represents. Cluster analysis aims to highlight
natural groups in a given population. By allowing the analysis of complex data, it reveals patterns of
characteristics that define different groups. In particular, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is a robust
clustering methodology, that reduces the data into a 2-dimension topological greed. The aim of this
study was to do a cluster analysis using a SOM, to reveal groups representing different metabolic
disease phenotypes, which may be useful in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and in
improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of these subjects. First, we applied a SOM to 1010 individuals from the Prevadiab2 cohort, reducing the data
dimensionality. For this algorithm we used anthropometric and biochemical parameters (27), which
are recognized as important in T2D pathophysiology. Then, based on a hierarchical cluster (Ward
method), we define the final clusters. We identified 10 clusters, with different anthropometric and metabolic profiles. All clusters
have individuals with normoglycemia and hyperglycemia (prediabetes and/or diabetes) in different
proportions. In the 5 clusters that contain people with diabetes, we also find individuals with
prediabetes, and surprisingly, even normoglycemic subjects, although the latter are present in a
smaller proportion. The application of SOM to a population, including normoglycemic and hyperglycemic people,
allowed the identification of groups with different anthropometric and metabolic phenotypes. More
relevant, the results obtained raise several important questions regarding the pathophysiological
mechanisms underlying the different phenotypes. The answer to these questions can have a decisive

Consider the following: how often do we see news on the newscast which we already knew through
Facebook or Twitter? At this point, we realize that perhaps some events that impact the population
could be detected earlier from different news channels.
Therefore, the objective of this work is to use Twitter publications (tweets) related to the flu to
understand if these ones have a relationship with the incidence of this disease, one of the most
worrying of Portuguese public health. This issue becomes particularly relevant when we look at the
global flu pandemic of 2009 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010). If flu dissemination
was predicted in a timely way, perhaps countries would have more time to prepare, collect the
resources needed to fight the outbreak and talk with the population about the procedures to take,
reducing the number of affected and consequent spread of the disease.
The methodology of this study is based on Data and Text Mining techniques. We started by defining
the terms related to flu, and then apply them for filtering, followed by data collection through an API
(Application Programming Interface) and its preprocessing. To have all dataset records classified, in
order to be possible later statistical application to perform the desired comparisons, Random Forest,
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression were tested, obtaining better results with Random Forest. This
algorithm was then used to classify the entire dataset using a subset of the data manually classified
as training.
In the analysis of results, different comparisons were made between official data and Twitter data
considering two different taxonomies for classification and time lag, that is considering that the
incidence on Twitter is detected before the official incidence. The relationship was tested with linear

To boost green cosmetics sales, it is crucial to understand the main reasons why consumers purchase these products and the strongest motives behind their buying intent. 
To address this gap, the present study analyzes consumers  perceived healthiness regarding green cosmetics against consumers  environmental behaviors and their perception about the environmental friendliness of these products, as well as the altruistic behaviors of the consumers. A model was developed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM technique), due to its  robustness and applicability to marketing research models. 
The findings suggest that despites products  environmental friendliness impact on consumers purchase intention being mediated by pure altruism, it is also moderated by consumers  perceived healthiness. Besides, perceived healthiness has a direct influence on purchase intent, as this relationship is also mediated by the consumers  perception on green cosmetics  safety and risks. This suggests that health is in a general a stronger predictor of green cosmetics buying intentions. 
Additionally, 60% of the variance explained is related with green cosmetics buying intentions, 23% with safety and risk perception regarding these products and 12% in respondents  level of pure altruism. 
This research contributes to marketing literature on cosmetic brands, that can use these conclusions to perform suitable marketing strategies to target more costumers, who seek for safety and health promoting effects in green cosmetics."

As it is impossible to treat every customer completely individually, let alone to provide them with fully customized products and services, it is clearly evident that they should be divided into a few groups in a reasonable manner, of course. 
Even though client segmentation has been present for many years, companies still struggle to use it correctly. They are trying to implement it properly as well as to integrate it into marketing strategy (Dibb & Simkin, 2009, p. 219). Instead of helping in more important, strategic areas, such as products and services innovation, pricing, and distribution channel selection, market segmentation has often been narrowly used for the needs of advertising (Yankelovich & Meer, 2006, p. 1). 
While the consumer market segmentation has been a challenging task for marketers, it has been an even more difficult job for those of industrial markets, or as Kukulas (2012, p. 2) had neatly illustrated with an example; whereas consumer marketers go fishing, business-to-business marketers have to fish for sharks. The business market segmentation is known to be much less developed in comparison to the consumer segmentation. However, some techniques of the latter can be also applied to the industrial markets. Yet, unless they want to be led into the wrong direction, practitioners have to be very careful about choosing and refining the appropriate variables on which to segment (Zimmerman & Blythe, 2013, p. 121)."

In both GA and GP, the algorithm starts with a random solution to a problem that is improved generation after generation building it on the positive traits of the previous generation and discarding traits that do not improve the solution. 
Repulsors consist of giving the learning algorithm some prior knowledge on the outcome of previous generations on a test set, to try to replace solutions that performed poorly on the data set with better ones. 
This thesis aims to test and document if the use of repulsors can change the behavior of GP, improve its learning rate and reduce overfitting thus also improving the generalization abilities? 
Overfitting is a problem in many machine learning algorithms, genetic programming (GP) is also affected by it, one of the objectives of this dissertation is to assess if overfitting can be reduced by using knowledge on the prior behavior of programs generated by GP on a validation data set, and, applying this knowledge to change the selection phase penalizing solutions similar to those that generalized poorly before. These poorly performing solutions will be called repulsors and are the main topic of this dissertation. 
We developed a program that implemented standard and repulsor based genetic programming. The program was then executed several times over some datasets and collect the results. Finally, the results were compared, and conclusions were taken. 
The results indicate that the use of repulsors produces better results on the training set and in the test set, this leads us to conclude that the use of repulsors has a positive effect on the performance of GP. 
The results indicate that the use of repulsors does indeed produce better results. On the training phase, seven out of the nine datasets showed improved algorithm performance when learning. In the test sets, the algorithm presented better generalization ability on five out of nine datasets. 
Studies could be extended to the use of multi-objective optimization when selecting individuals, and the extension of the repulsor list to other (independent) runs with the same parameters and dataset."

health data, the preparation process for the simultaneous application in May 2018 of the
requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the new Directive for Network

The conditions to which the processing of personal data is subject in Portugal, as well as the
minimum requirements for the level of adequacy and compliance with the respective GDPR and NIS
Directive rules, were disclosed to public entities that are part of the National Health Service (NHS) by
the Shared Services of the Ministry of Health (SSMH) through the ""Information Privacy Guide for the
Health Sector in Portugal"" (the Guide), which also consolidated some good practices and actions
specifically addressed to the different profiles of stakeholders and Entities.
In addition, the Guide establishes that organizations of the Ministry of Health (MH) and the NHS
must operate in accordance with the general principles and good information security practices (eg
ISO 27001), even if they do not have a certification. In other words, in addition to the
implementation of the privacy and information security controls themselves, it is necessary to
implement an Integrated Information Security and Privacy Management System (IISPMS), which
should ensure compliance with obligations that go beyond the security field, such as the fulfilment of
the rights of data subjects and questions of lawfulness and fair treatment.
In order to deepen the definition of the IISPMS for the health sector and to facilitate its
implementation, it was decided to summarize the scope of the present work to the development of a
generic framework that can be subsequently used by the Entities of the Health sector in Portugal to
guide them through the process of preparation for GDPR application. The results of this work could
be used for evaluating of the level of compliance with the requirements of the GDPR, ISO/IEC 27001:
2013 and ones of the SSMH Guide, as well as for the consecutive development of the IISPMS
implementation roadmap.
The proposed approach is not limited only by the field of controls' implementation, but additionally
provides mechanisms to define the scope of implementation, as well as sustain and improve the

usually recur to ratios commonly used in financial analysis. 
From the comparative study of (1) logistic regression-based models with the forward stepwise method

daily overcrowding. If the emergency services are part of a wider system that aims to provide

being global, assumes special criticism in nations with health systems based on beveridgian matrix, in
which universal access to health care is guaranteed to all its citizens. Therefore, is it important to
know which characteristics are at the basis of the demand for health care by non-urgent situations.
This type of demand was chosen because they are those in which hospital health services in Portugal
can, in partnership with primary health care, establish governance protocols aimed at reducing
access to their emergency services.
At the same time, today, we are witnessing the rise, hitchhiking the evolution of the digital society, of
new areas of knowledge that, seeking to overcome the traditional methodologies of data analysis,
aims, with the use of their own methodologies, to create knowledge that has not been addressed
before those traditional approaches. Thus, the present work seeks, through machine learning
processes, to establish criteria, based on the importance of the variables, for the classification of
episodes of false urgencies. Based on these premises and, based on a database with information on
the general emergency episodes of a large NHS hospital that took place over 5 years, 3 decision trees
were built, testing their performance, using such is the analysis of the error rate associated with the
classification of these episodes. In addition, it was also used a comparison between some data ming
(DM) algorithms, concluding that the random forest, using only 14 decision trees, presents the best
results.
Although the potentialities of decision trees are many, in fact the error rate observed in the
classification of false urgencies is still high, which may indicate that there will be other variables,
especially in the association factors, as defined by Pines et. al. (2013) that contribute to the decision
to enter the emergency service even when the severity of the situation is residual and that the data

Apache Spark is a relatively new alternative to Hadoop MapReduce and claims to offer a performance boost up to 10 times for certain applications, while maintaining its automatic fault tolerance. To leverage the Data Warehouse capabilities of Hadoop Apache Hive was introduced. It is a concept for Big Data analytics that works on top of Hadoop and provides data analysis tools and most importantly translates queries to MapReduce and Spark jobs. Therefore, it exploits the scalability of Hadoop and offers data exploration and mining capabilities to non-developers. However, it is difficult for users to utilize the full potential of the Apache Spark execution engine. This results in very long execution times. Therefore, this project work gives researches and companies a tuning methodology that significantly can improve the execution time of queries. As a result, this tuning methodology could optimize a real-world batch-processing query by 5 times. Moreover, it gives insides in the underlying reasons of this big improvement by using Apache Spark Monitoring tools. The result can be helpful for many practitioners and researchers that would like to optimise the performance of Spark and MapReduce queries executed in Hive on top of an Apache Hadoop cluster."

on. In other words, we will assess the evolution of differences in preferences between
individuals that were connected in the social network, in order to understand if there is a
trend of these differences diminishing over time.
A Sequential-Based algorithm, more specifically, a Hidden Markov Model is used to
predict the change in musical genre preferences. This was done by considering each
individual  own preferences as well as the preferences of his connections within the social
network with the ultimate goal of assessing how influential the network is in the evolution of

their credit scoring methods. In the recent years, machine learning has shown improvement over the 
common traditional methods for the application of credit scoring. Even small improvements in 
prediction quality are of great interest for the financial institutions. 
In this thesis classification methods are applied to the credit data of the Frankfurter Sparkasse to score 
their credits. Since recent research has shown that ensemble methods deliver outstanding prediction 
quality for credit scoring, the focus of the model investigation and application is set on such methods. 
Additionally, the typical imbalanced class distribution of credit scoring datasets makes us consider 
sampling techniques, which compensate the imbalances for the training dataset. We evaluate and 
compare different types of models and techniques according to defined metrics. Besides delivering a 
high prediction quality, the model  outcome should be interpretable as default probabilities. Hence, 
calibration techniques are considered to improve the interpretation of the model  scores. We find 
ensemble methods to deliver better results than the best single model. Specifically, the method of the 
Random Forest delivers the best performance on the given data set. When compared to the traditional 
credit scoring methods of the Frankfurter Sparkasse, the Random Forest shows significant 
improvement when predicting a borrower  default within a 12-month period. The Logistic Regression 
is used as a benchmark to validate the performance of the model."

Data strategies that include the creation and maintenance of data warehouses have a lot to gain by incorporating technologies from the Big Data  spectrum. Hadoop, as a transformation tool, can add a theoretical infinite dimension of data processing, feeding transformed information into traditional data warehouses that ultimately will retain their value as central components in organizations  decision support systems. 
This study explores the potentialities of Hadoop as a data transformation tool in the setting of a traditional data warehouse environment. Hadoop  execution model, which is oriented for distributed parallel processing, offers great capabilities when the amounts of data to be processed require the infrastructure to expand. Horizontal scalability, which is a key aspect in a Hadoop cluster, will allow for proportional growth in processing power as the volume of data increases. 
Through the use of a Hive on Tez, in a Hadoop cluster, this study transforms television viewing events, extracted from Ericsson  Mediaroom Internet Protocol Television infrastructure, into pertinent audience metrics, like Rating, Reach and Share. These measurements are then made available in a traditional data warehouse, supported by a traditional Relational Database Management System, where they are presented through a set of reports. 
The main contribution of this research is a proposed augmented data warehouse architecture where the traditional ETL layer is replaced by a Hadoop cluster, running Hive on Tez, with the purpose of performing the heaviest transformations that convert raw data into actionable information. Through a typification of the SQL statements, responsible for the data transformation processes, we were able to understand that Hadoop, and its distributed processing model, delivers outstanding performance results associated with the analytical layer, namely in the aggregation of large data sets. 
Ultimately, we demonstrate, empirically, the performance gains that can be extracted from Hadoop, in comparison to an RDBMS, regarding speed, storage usage and scalability potential, and suggest how this can be used to evolve data warehouses into the age of Big Data."

Therefore, cities should be eager to receive their share of inhabitants, seeking to host within their borders the optimal number of people needed to self-development and thrive. 
At the same time, urban areas must be prepared to offer citizens the services matching their expectations, in fields such as education, healthcare, transportation, water and energy supply. More people demanding for more services requires either a higher need of resources or a better utilization of the available ones. In a context of economic adjustments, the second option is normally the most viable. 
The concept of Smart City is brought to discussion as a city that, with the support of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), creates a system that progressively facilitates its own functioning, becoming more intelligent, interconnected and sustainable (Debnath et al., 2014). Nowadays, technology allows people to send and receive data in real-time, with this data acting as a supporter for quicker and fact-based decisions, granting us the possibility of saving precious resources, as time or capital. 
Resource efficiency is one of Lean Thinking potentialities. This line of thought is used within organizational context to, among other applications, identify activities embedded in business process that do not add value to the final product or service. In this investigation work, it is proposed to apply Lean Thinking in the development of an integrated administration system for a city, within the Smart Cities paradigm, to allow urban managers to take advantage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for a better utilization of resources, minimizing waste of the available reserves."

After literature review on theories of transformational leadership and social capital, the impact of these contextual factors on the government environment of a Brazilian public agency (Ministry of the Environment) was verified.
Using an empirical approach, the survey collected data from 295 public officials, using online questionnaire, obtained as results that the individual performance at work, using KMS, positively affects the organizational performance, being also impacted by factors such as intensity of the KMS use, user satisfaction and social capital. User satisfaction impacts individual performance, being affected by the frequency and intensity of KMS use, as well as by social capital, which plays a relevant role in individual and organizational performances, amplifying the relationship between user satisfaction and individual performance, given its moderating effect. 
Organizational performance is influenced by transformational leadership, responsible for moderating the connections among individual and institutional performance. The research provided relevant information to the literature on KMS, to connect system use, satisfaction and performance, elucidating the importance of social capital to achieve better results in government contexts."

Impacts of IT can also be found in educational processes. Nowadays, marks of chalk in classrooms can only be found within an Art class. Majority of classrooms are equipped with at least one of the IT innovations; computer, projector, interactive white board, internet connection, etc. 
Since today  pupils are raised with presence of modern IT at every step and consequently with the modern lifestyle, they are losing the initial contact with the traditional way of learning. That is why it makes sense to think about alternatives to traditional learning, to raise the motivation among students and prepare them to accept more information, as well as to link new information with the already obtained knowledge and store it in long-term memory (Clark & Mayer, 2011, p. 36). 
Integrating technologies in educational process offers alternative channels to deliver knowledge in pursuit of promoting learning and motivating pupils. In the last few years, we have been witnesses to a large promotion of e-materials use in classrooms. However, use of e-materials does not only require technologically equipped classrooms, but mostly a change in the way of teaching. Since the educational system has been moving quite slowly towards changes, there has not been a massive adoption of e-materials in classrooms, especially by teachers (Demetriadis et al., 2003, pp. 19-20)."

Levels of an organization designed to provide a reasonable level of security. 
The internal control framework offers three categories of distinct objectives, but overlaps: (i) operations, relative to the effectiveness of operations, (ii) reporting, relating to internal and external financial and non-financial information, and (ii) Compliance with the rules and regulations to which the organization is subject. 
We can then say that it is expected that an internal control system will increase the organization's likelihood that the objectives related to external information and compliance with rules and regulations will be achieved. 
To achieve a systematic and disciplined approach, organizations develop the Internal Controls Framework (ICF) designated in Portuguese by Internal Control Methodology (ICM). The purpose of this document is to comply with the legal provisions, and it also represents a real concern on the part of the Organization, which has developed it in matters such as transparency of procedures, responsibility for the management of its resources and control of processes to create added value. In this regard, this report describes the design and subsequent implementation of the effective internal control system in a leading telecommunications company in Africa using as reference framework the integrated internal control framework COSO and its five components of environment control, Risks, control activities, information and communication, and activity monitoring. The main idea is to contribute to the establishment of an internal control system to improve organizational performance and oversight, safeguard assets, verify the reliability of financial information, ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and reduce the possibility of fraud. 
Within the broad and complex process of establishing internal control within one of Angola's leading telecommunications companies, it was decided for time and space issues in this internship report to divide it into three mini projects, with project 1 being the planning of the Internal control system, project 2 the inventory of the processes and procedures of the company, the project 3 the design of the controls, the project 4 the implementation of internal control and the project 5 the monitoring of internal control. As for projects 2, 3 and 4, the large number of procedures developed (47) were grouped by three main components, the priority given the positive impact if it was developed, the ease of execution and the coverage of the work teams, The result of this analysis was that the first module to be developed contained three accounts payable procedures which would be developed in detail as a pilot initiative. This scope will apply to the development and explanation of the work carried out, which includes the design, implementation and monitoring of the internal control of the pilot project of accounts payable. This first initiative would be crucial to captivate and motivate the different areas of the organization, so that the success of this first initiative was crucial to the implementation of the rest of the modules. 
The internal control system was developed and implemented as a trainee at Deloitte with a leading telecom customer in an African country facing the challenge of implementing a short-term internal control system."

temperature and precipitation appear to be critical in perpetuating malaria transmission. In the last 
decades, there has been an increased interest in the use of weather forecasts for predicting malaria 
epidemics and setting up early warning systems. 
In 2017, there have been almost 9 million reported cases of malaria in Mozambique. Malaria is 
considered one of the deadliest diseases in the country. Previous studies have established that 
temperature, rainfall and humidity were determinant for malaria transmission and intensity in this 
region. The purpose of this study is to apply time series analysis and regression modelling to analyse 
the relationship between malaria incidence and these climatic variables in Chimoio, a municipality 
located in central Mozambique, and possibly develop a model that can accurately predict the 
occurrence of malaria outbreaks across this region. 
With a combination of two (15-week lagged maximum temperature and 3-week lagged precipitation) 
to three (15-week lagged maximum temperature, 12-week lagged relative humidity and 3-week 
lagged precipitation) climatic variables, added to the number of malaria cases reported in the 
previous week, we were able to explain more than 70% of the variability in weekly malaria incidence. 
These models also quite accurately represent the observed trends of malaria incidence in Chimoio, 
during the study period. 
This simple and economical approach, supported by meteorological and epidemiologic data that are 
readily available, could potentially be applied by local health authorities in order to predict malaria 
outbreaks. With this information, adequate preventative interventions and resource allocation could 
be planned and deployed within a more reasonable time frame. 
Further studies are required in order to determine if this methodology can be successfully applied to 
other regions of the globe."

CBR can help to support BPM, making better decisions with existing knowledge when solving process problems. This study investigates effectively store, retrieve, and adapt Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) solutions that best fit the underlying BPM problem using case-based reasoning as a tool. Therefore, a theoretical model was proposed, containing each CBR live cycle phase with different possible tools applied to BPMN diagrams, which was validated by expert interviews. This study concludes that a whole CBR life cycle can be applied to BPMN diagram problems with the need for human intervention. This work did not have the objective to solve the whole problem but to contribute to a possible solution by using CBR through a theoretical model."

characterize clusters in data. Due to the multidimensional nature of clustering, the discipline of outlier 
detection is a complex task as statistical approaches are not adequate. 
In this research work, we contend that for clustering, outliers should be perceived as observations with 
deviating characteristics worsening the ratio of intra-cluster and inter-cluster distance. We present a 
research question that deals with improving clustering results specifically for the two clustering 
algorithms, k-means and hierarchical clustering, by the means of outlier detection. To improve clustering 
results, we identify and discuss the literature of outlier detection, and undertake on 11 algorithms and 2 
statistical test to the process of treating data prior to clustering. To evaluate the results of applied 
clustering, six evaluation metrics are applied, of which one metric is introduced in this study. 
Using real world datasets, we demonstrate that outlier detection does improve clustering results with 
respect to clustering objectives, but only to an extent where data allows it. That is, if data contains  real  
clusters and actual outliers, proper use of outlier algorithms improves clustering significantly. Advantages 
and disadvantages for outlier algorithms, when dealing with different types of data, are discussed along 
with the different properties of evaluation metrics describing the fulfillment of clustering objectives. 
Finally, it is demonstrated that the main challenge of improving clustering results for users, with regards 
to outlier detection, is the lack of tools to understand data structures prior to clustering. Future research 
is emphasized for tools such as dimension reduction, to help users avoid applying every tool in the toolbox."

Due to its increasing scope, IT projects are getting more and more complex and expectations on their results are at an all-time high. At this rate, there is no telling where this complexity will lead, nor if expectations can be met. The development of IT project, or projects of any kind, is always met with unforeseen risks. Therefore, models that aim to estimate the success of these projects have been emerging. 
Some of these tools have fallen upon the bias of only taking into consideration a few project management variables for forecasting success. This may lead to inaccurate estimations, from the point-of-view of the several stakeholders. 
Considering the intricacy of IT projects, and the several aspects that influence them, advanced statistical models are required to give rich insight into projects  outcome. On the other hand, project success cannot be fully determined if the stakeholders  points-of-view are not taken into account. In other words, the success index of a project must be estimated having stakeholders taken into consideration. 
In order to support the mentioned concerns, a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks was developed. Projects and stakeholders characteristics are defined, along with projects  success criteria as inputs of the model, generating success indexes by budget, time and scope performance, as well as an overall success index as outputs. 
This dissertation adds to the current literature on the subject, by demonstrating the importance of stakeholder characteristics in project estimation and paving a pathway for the further exploration of the model developed. Thus making a first step into building a prediction tool to help mitigate the current risks of IT projects and software development."

Consequently, innovation is also crucial to the economic growth of a country (Bilbao-Osorio and RodrÈguez-Pose, 2004). The aim of this work is to identify and characterize Portuguese firms innovation patterns using CIS3 (1998-2000) and CIS4 (2002-2004) data for both manufacturing and service sectors and to compare the results between them. Through a Cluster Analysis we identify and define three clusters in each sector for each period of time. The results show that there are differences between sectors and that some changes occurred through time, namely those related to innovation objectives and sources of information. We conclude that innovative pattern of firms in service sector in period 2002-2004 is significantly different from the innovative pattern of manufacturing and service sector firms in 1998-2000. Comparing our results for CIS3 and service sector with those obtained for Spain and published by Camacho and Rodriguez (2008), we conclude that there are differences in the strategies of the innovation activities and in the distribution of innovation expenditures between the two countries and similarities in what concern with the main innovation objectives and sources of information. The two countries also differ in the way firms of different industries innovate; in service sector, in 1998-2000, while Spanish firm  innovative behaviour was heterogeneous within industries, in Portugal the firm  behaviour was homogeneous."

atrial fibrillation after the first ablation, to improve the prediction of success/failure.
Methods: It  a retrospective study with predictive goal, that uses a sample of individuals that
were submitted to atrial fibrillation catheter ablation by pulmonary veins isolation, in one specialized
centre, between 2011 and 2016 and with a minimum of 1 year follow up. We use and evaluate
variables from the centre database, then we pre-process and transform the data, so it could be used
for the prediction algorithms. In the end those algorithms were evaluated, compared and we chose
the best.
Results: For the building of the prediction algorithms we used data from 437 patients, with
average age of 60,8 years, 317 without relapse had an average follow up of 25,3 months, and 120
with relapse with an average follow up time of 16,1 months (time when the relapse was declared).
We evaluated the predictive capability of each variable and we identified the left atrial volume and
the type of atrial fibrillation as the best predicting variables. The best algorithm was the Gradient

Secondly, the wine packaging was analyzed following Silayoi & Speece és (2007) approach: the wine 
label information was analysed as the primary informational element; and label design, shape, size 
and type of closure were analysed as the primary visual elements. The data was gathered through an

significant differences on the importance of the informational elements on wine label for the four

increasing appearance of innovative packaging, consumers prefer labels with traditional designs and 
bottles with cork; when creating wine labels, marketers should give more attention to the Expert

evolved and has a powerful positioning in the new digital era. With this, the main challenge to
the brands is to create a solid relationship and loyalty with its consumers through digital
channels. Obviously, this is not a premise that only appeared with the evolution of the digital
channels. In traditional commerce, the brands also must conquer the loyalty of the consumers in
order to retain them and to obtain better results. However, when we speak in  digital loyalty, ù
there are several conditions that must be considered. These, in part, are very different from the
ones in traditional commerce. In traditional commerce, there is some physical contact, a bigger
approach, and it is easier to decide disputes, which makes it easier for the creation of a
relationship between the brand and the consumer. In e-commerce, the same does not happen.
And, therefore, the challenge to the brands is more significant and more demanding, to create
lasting and loyal relationships with the consumers there are a series of antecedents, which are
fundamental for the success of these relations. Thus, the main objective of the present study is to make an analysis of the antecedents of eloyalty, that is, in the construction of lasting relations between the millennial's digital consumers
and the brand. Regarding consumer behavior, in its generality, it has been characterized by an
online purchase profile. However, the consumer took the same desire to be well cared for, from
the physical world to the digital world. Thus, it is necessary for the brands to adopt the same
attitude, adapting it to this new form of commerce, and with some inherent challenges: to know
which are the antecedents of good digital experiences and, in consequence, for the construction
of relations of loyalty between the digital consumer and the brand. The online consumer, when
satisfied with the digital experience, becomes a brand promoter, which is sufficiently positive
both for the success of the brand and for a stronger relationship of the consumer with it.
The first phase in this study was the collection of information to build a survey based on the
literature review, which led to the construction of a model and the formulation of hypotheses.
The literature review allowed us to identify the main determinants of digital loyalty, and with
the submission of an online survey to 213 individuals, it was possible to test the veracity of such

To extenuate the environmental issues adjacent to climate change, strengthening the number of urban trees is essential as they mitigate CO2 emissions when incorporating carbon in their biomass. Understanding and measuring the extent of the role trees play as a mechanism for CO2 storage introduces an interesting study that provides information on urban green infrastructures planification. Additionally, attending the relation between carbon storage and carbon value, the trees represent a credit benefit for the cities.

evolution, the management of excess of information becomes unsustainable for managers, as
decision making becomes complex and confusing. The emergence and development of effective
Business Intelligence tools to analyze large volumes of data has made it possible to centralize
information and make it easily accessible and interpretable.
The project's analysis case regards  Empresa X ù, a company recognized for its activity in the
telecommunications sector. Within the management control area, the main objective is to
control the daily operational activity of the retail network channels - the stores. In this area it is
very relevant to control traffic and service quality. Currently, the company chooses to do the
data processing through the production of individual weekly reports in Excel documents. This
process, since it is not automated, besides being time-consuming for the employees who
perform it, is also not easy to interpret for those who analyze it. One of the data sources updated
daily is the information about the queue management system. This system allows the company
to have the data of the tickets records being able to evaluate the traffic in the stores. Therefore,
the purpose of the project is to create a BI solution that allows the optimization of data use in
order to help managers make informed decisions in advance, depending on the information
about their current overall performance and which internal and external factors may influence
it. The solution should fit to any organization that has similar information.
To implement the BI solution the best option is to design and conceive a visual analytic solution
that would allow the information to be aggregated and more user-friendly, so that the user can
freely navigate the data and make immediate decisions based on facts taken from the
observation of interactive and manipulative visualizations. This solution is supported by a tool
that allows the entire process of extraction, transformation and data loading in a data

The main causes associated with air pollution are the burn of fossil fuels, agriculture, exhaust from factories and industries, residential heating and natural disasters. 
Air quality in United States is a problem that has been addressed for the last three decades, since the creation of the Clean Air Act program. But, although the air quality has relatively improved over the years, air pollution is still a problem: (Caiazzo, Ashok, Waitz, Yim, & Barrett, 2013) referred that total combustion emissions in US are accountable for about 200,000 premature deaths per year, due to PM2.5 concentrations and 10,000 deaths due to Ozone concentration changes, also the American Lung Association estimated that air pollution related illness costs of approximately $37 billion dollars each year in the US, with California alone hitting $15 billion (Holmes-gen & Barrett, 2016). In the face of increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, scholars have conducted a significant quantity of related research, and in those studies, the forecasting of air pollution has been of paramount importance.

The research is based on trips raw telematics data generated over 5 months by telematics black-box devices installed in the cars of 937 customers. The data are solely related to trips, with granularity at the finest level of individual geospatial coordinate sets composing trajectories. The features describing each timestamped GPS coordinate set are average speed in the last second, heading, GPS quality, meters travelled since previous position. The data sources consist of semi-structured data stored in several flat files in their native format, batch extracted from the data lake. 
Starting from trips raw telematics data at the granular level of geospatial coordinate sets, they are extensively studied and enriched with additional open data sources exploiting spatial join operations. Next, a complex concatenation of data preparation tasks is performed to obtain the final dataset, aggregated at the granular level of trips and described by 117 features. The final dataset is fed to the k-means algorithm for discovering patterns over trips characteristics. Patterns are studied considering the overall portfolio, regardless of driver and intentionally neglecting historical or personal information. 
The study concludes by deploying the clustering results to profile customers, bringing to a new level the risk knowledge of the line of business about its customers. This discovery opens a world of new possibilities, some of the uncountable examples are improve pricing, using results in fraud detection and offering new services and overall risk prevention for customers."

to analyze consumption patterns in real time. However, without an appropriate and smart application
of the available tools providing you a complete visualization and analysis of data, results might become

Considering the fact that this sector is an environment where decisions are time-sensitive, there is an
increased need for proper real-time business intelligence solutions (RTBI). These solutions will help
companies improve their customer experiences and maximize their operational efficiencies, while
contributing to optimize decision-making timings.
The main goal of this dissertation is to develop a model of RTBI solution that can contribute to a more
efficient use of water in cities, focusing on the stage of domestic consumption of the water cycle. On
one hand, this solution intends to be able to identify, through real-time monitoring, consumption flows
outside the usual curve of consumption signaling water-leaks or another factor disrupting the normal
household consumption pattern. On the other hand, the idea of building this solution is to generate
enough information on volumes of household consumption in order to map consumers behavior,
through their volumes, impacting and encouraging them towards a smarter consumption. Through
Microsoft BI tools, one will be able to implement a complete and effective platform providing users
the needed information in a much more easy and visual way.
Besides the relevant analysis and customized BI solution to this specific problem, this dissertation
presents a case study based on an existing service provided by a Brazilian company named Aquasave.

Universities worldwide feel this pressure of a data-driven approach that requires the power of a centralized analytical platform that Business Intelligence (BI) solutions provide, in order to adjust their current market offer based on the insights provided. 
In this project report it was discussed an implementation of a BI prototype in an academic institution, more specifically at Universidade CatÛlica Portuguesa (UCP). The main goal was to migrate the current approach of using transactional databases to an analytical solution. This allowed the University (1) to better understand key performance indicators that affect main competitive areas, such as students (enrolments, graduates), and (2) to apply these insights to their strategic business goals. 
To achieve such endeavours, this BI project at UCP followed an adapted Business Intelligence Roadmap methodology. The input data came from transactional databases and Excel files. Microsoft BI solutions were the main source of technology to deal with the ETL pipeline and report development. 
In terms of results, this project allowed UCP to take another step towards a data-driven decision-making mindset, with a system that can help in the identified business needs, but also with implications that can be further explored outside of UCP boundaries, by providing a practical end-to-end use case, that can support other Universities environments and projects."

Thus, how stress and consumers  reactions towards stressful situations impact behaviors became a hot topic of investigation. Stress mindset is an inside powerful motive which is becoming an essential factor in consumer behavior through the decision-making process. For instance, an important source of stressful situations regards the global warning about the future of our planet. Since consumers are increasingly stressed, sustainable consumption concerns became key factors in consumer research, policymaking, and for all the business stakeholders interested in sustainability. 
This research examines the relationship between stress and sustainable consumption, proposing that consumer stress mindsets (enhancing vs. debilitating) can impact altruism and sustainable consumption. Two experimental studies show how types of stress mindset are associated with sustainable consumption (study 1) and how pure and competitive altruism is derived by stress mindset (study 2). 
Theoretically, this study extends previous findings by showing that enhancing (vs. debilitating) stress mindset is indeed associated with sustainable consumption. Our findings also suggest that enhancing stress mindset and competitive altruism can lead to a greater influence on eco-friendly consumption intentions. In practical terms, the finding informs companies how specific combinations of stress mindset and competitive altruism can raise sustainable consumption."

In addition to traditional flaws (such as illumination, pose, occlusion in part of face image), the low performance of the system with dark skin images and female faces raises questions that challenge transparency and accountability of the system. Recent work has suggested that available datasets are causing this issue, but little work has been done with other face recognition methods. Also, little work has been done on facial features such as hair as a key face feature in the face recognition system. 
To address the gaps this thesis examines the performance of three face recognition methods (eigenface, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Convolution Neuron Network (CNN)) with respect to skin color changes in two different face mode  only face  ù and  face with hair  ù. 
The following work is reported in this study, 1st rebuild approximate PPB dataset based on work done by  Joy Adowaa Buolamwini  ù in her thesis entitled  Gender shades  ù. 2nd new classifier tools developed, and the approximate PPB dataset classified based on new methods in 12 classes. 3rd the three methods assessed with approximate PPB dataset in two face mode. 
The evaluation of the three methods revealed an interesting result. In this work, the eigenface method performs better than ICA and CNN. Moreover, the result shows a strong positive correlation between the numbers of train sets and results that it can prove the previous finding about lack of image with dark skin. More interestingly, despite the claims, the models showed a proactive behavior in female  face identification. Despite the female group shape 21% of the population in the top two skin type groups, the result shows 44% of the top 3 recall for female groups. Also, it confirms that adding hair to images in average boosts the results by up to 9%.

This research investigates how self-signaling influences consumers  willingness to adopt sustainable behaviors in the fashion industry, extending prior research on the motivations to adopt sustainable consumption behaviors that are not entirely altruistic and might also reflect self-interest motives (i.e., ownership and status). Findings from 2 studies are used to test the proposed model and suggest that individuals are more inclined to engage in positive word of mouth (WOM) about sustainable fashion practices when they have stronger symbolic signaling feelings for such practices. Additionally, these feelings induced by Slow Fashion elevate strong status motives. By doing so, this research addresses the gap between consumers  actual attitudes towards fashion sustainability and the reasons why they are acquiring such behaviors in respect to self-signaling. This research has key implications for researchers and fashion industry practitioners, on how Slow Fashion is associated with self-signaling, ownership and status motives."

Guests profiles were assessed with data about 498.655 loyalty members  of Pestana Hotel Group. The K-means algorithm was applied in order to group the similar guests based on the monetary value of clients and consumption behavior. The goal is to compare the data-driven segments which are based on the customer  monetary value, brand preferences and demographic data with the loyalty program tiers. The results demonstrate that the widely used tier-based loyalty programs are not optimal and are hiding important features that could be used to improve clients  segmentation. Findings suggest that some high tier members generate comparatively less revenue for the hotel than lower tier ones. Hence, more efforts should be focused on truly valuable clients. Loyalty programs are not equally suitable for all guests neither for all brands within a hotel group, therefore additional levels of segmentation would be appropriate to match the distinct guests  behavior.

specific context is analysed, through its frequency and valence, taking into consideration three
drivers: brand awareness, attitudes toward advertising in general and consumers  perceived value
from the campaign. In addition, the impact of WOM will also be analysed (represented by the two
aforementioned dimensions) in consumer's intention to purchase the advertised product.
The data was gathered from an online survey conducted to 175 consumers, who stated to be familiar
with the abovementioned campaign. The data collected was analysed through the modelling of
structural equations (PLS-SEM).
In fact, WOM evidenced to have a crucial impact in the awareness of this advertising campaign as
most of the consumers mentioned that they became familiar with this initiative due to their friends
and family and not because of the advertising made by Nespresso.
The results also showed that the perceived value of the advertising campaign is the driver with the
greatest impact on the frequency and positive value of WOM generated by consumers, meaning that
the consumer  opinions explain the frequency of the positive valence which they spoke of the
campaign. Regarding brand awareness towards advertising in general, it has not been proven that it
influences the frequency and positive valence of WOM. As for the intention of purchase of the
advertised product, positive valence is the only dimension that is statistically significant to explain
why consumers want to buy the product. That is, the more positively the consumers talked about the
advertising campaign, the greater their intention to purchase the advertised product. It was also
possible to conclude, that the frequency that consumers talk about the campaign has no influence
over the purchase intention of the advertised product.
The success of an advertising campaign is reflected in a greater intention of consumers to buy the
product that it is being promoted. Thus, it is crucial to create advertising campaigns that consumers
identify themselves with in order to spread the word with other customers by talking positively
about them."

Self-expressive brands that are followed on Instagram revealed to pursuit a very important impact in brand love. Furthermore, the present study also revealed a positive relationship between loved brands not only with WOM but also with brand acceptance among consumers who engage with a brand on Instagram in Portugal. In opposition, the current study shows that there is no relationship between self-expressive brands followed on Instagram and brand acceptance or WOM.

The results of this investigation show that the consumers participating on Instagram brands

Small and medium-sized firms are starting to win over large corporations in what can be considered a deeply fragmented market. It is as one of these firms that Pegasus Consultancy (hereafter: Pegasus), specialized in training, sales enablement, consultancy and office automation, works to stand out to and gain awareness. However, factors such as the company  reduced dimension, lack of available budget and a generally perceived discredit on marketing  efficiency lead to a concerning absence of the necessary marketing expertise to grow as an industry leader. 
This project, based on a short-term internship, emerges as a first attempt to tackle this issue, providing Pegasus with a well-defined social media strategy. Taking into consideration how crucial it is for business growth to generate leads and how LinkedIn is seen as the most effective social platform to achieve it, the project focused on these two elements: lead generation and LinkedIn. 
Referring to the SOSTAC model built by Smith (2017), and to other works of reference in the marketing field that complemented Smith  theory, the way Pegasus interacts with LinkedIn as a leads  provider is analyzed and put into perspective with what authors consider to be its optimized use. The comparison demonstrates that the company is aware of how to benefit from the platform  search possibilities, using it frequently to find prospects and new partners. Nonetheless, Pegasus does not enjoy LinkedIn  full functionalities when it comes to directly generating leads, extending awareness, creating engagement with audiences and driving traffic towards its website. 
A strategy was consequently outlined to optimize the use of the platform, with objectives that focus on improving the performance of the elements described above, a target that aligns with the company  business needs and a set of tactics, which, through multiple actions that will be monitored over time, assure that progressive results will be accomplished. 
Overall, the project  intent is to guide Pegasus on its first contact with a structured marketing approach, demonstrating how valuable LinkedIn can be as a direct and indirect source of engaged customers. Hopefully, a new mentality that is more embracing of marketing efforts and assigns greater value to social media will arise, not only with Pegasus but also with companies of similar characteristics, which might refer to this study in the future."

The use of chatbots has been gaining some prominence in several service areas, namely in customer
support service, presenting itself as an optimal and efficient tool, due to its ability to respond to
several requests from different customers simultaneously and in real time 24 / 7.
Although this technology is still in an intermediate stage of development, it shows already evident
and unequivocal potentials. This is clearly an option to be taken into account by organizations, which
need an customer support service as a factor of satisfaction for their partners, in an extended
timeframe (24/7) and under controlled implementation and use costs.
This project, developed as part of the master's thesis in partnership with Cascais PrÛxima, aims to
develop and implement a chatbot solution (MobiBot) for the customer support service of the
MobiCascais. It is intended to evaluate if the MobiBot solution really represents a good complement
to the customer support service of the MobiCascais, from the perspective of the user and the
company.
In an initial phase, the theme was defined based on the state-of-the-art of the customer support
service of the MobiCascais and specifying the bikesharing service, finding that way the base for the
development and implementation of this solution.
From several meetings with some departments of Cascais PrÛxima, it was enabled the analysis of
requirements and consequently the clarification of the scope of the project.
In the subsequent phase, a literature review was carried out in order to expand the knowledge and
support the project in its several aspects, such as the choice of the platform for its development,
metrics that allow assessing the performance of MobiBot, the strategy to developing and monitoring
the evolution of MobiBot , among other topics.
Then, it was structured the working methodology for the entire project, moving on to the
architecture of its design and development of the MobiBot, which considered the different
components to be integrated, as well as the way they interact between each other.
The phase after consisted in testing and analysing its usability, to implement the improvements in
the MobiBot, before it was implemented in the MobiCascais App.
In the implementation and testing phase, it was given the opportunity to some users from the
MobiCascais to interact with the solution by their support requests, generating that way records of
these interactions, which were analysed later in order to validate the usefulness from the MobiBot in
the user / customer support service relationship from the MobiCascais. Therefore, it was concluded that MobiBot carried out with great success, the tasks within the scope
for which it was designed. Due to the decrease in calls to the traditional telephone channel of the
customer support service from MobiCascais, it also confirmed the add value of this solution.
This project creates space for new future developments, both in expanding the scope of works from
MobiBot as well as the quality of its service."

However, many companies have not yet very clear the idea and practice of customer focus . The competition is becoming more diverse, each industry has more and more players, so it is harder to obtain differentiation, and thus the concept of customer experience is of particular importance as a source of differentiation in many industries. By providing memorable experiences the chance of a higher customer satisfaction will be higher, with a positive ""word of mouth"" positive and higher repeat purchase probability. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the importance of the one factor that contributes decisively to the customer experience: co-creation, that can be defined as the client or other stakeholder participation in the design, development and implementation of products and/or services. The consumer assumes a more active role in relation to the company and the creation of value is performed bilaterally, for instance, the value is co- created as a result of interaction between the actors. To analyze this theme it was chosen the hotel sector, specifically 5 -stars hotels. This choice was based on fact that in this kind of hotels the involvement of the consumer is normally higher. Outstanding experiences create great value for guests. All moments of interaction between the hotel and the consumer contribute to the quality of experience. So, the methodology adopted in this study combined two types of research: qualitative and quantitative. The first consisted of analyzing booking.com site reviews of 5 star hotels in the cities of Lisbon, Madrid and London. The main objective was to understand how co- created value through content that is shared on this digital platform.

In addition, other aspects such as the decoration, dimensions and toilet utensils were mentioned as relevant .The quantitative analysis was performed by applying a questionnaire via online to a convenience sample of the Portuguese population that has had at least one experience during the last year in a five star hotel. The preparation of this questionnaire was based on consumer behavior scale developed on the model of Yi and Gong (2013). After testing the model, the results pointed that from the eight dimensions defined by YI and Gong (2013), only tolerance, assistance, personal interaction and information sharing were considered as relevant in the context studied."

though the percentage of budget allocated towards digital media has been increasing. Since the 
largest part of sales still happen in physical stores, marketers face the challenge of optimizing their 
media mix to maximize revenue. 
To address this challenge, media mix models were developed using the traditional modeling 
approach, based on linear regressions, with data from a retailer  advertising campaign, specifically 
the online and offline investments per channel and online conversion metrics. 
The models were influenced by the selection bias regarding funnel effects, which was exacerbated by 
the use of the last-touch attribution model that tends to disproportionately skew marketer 
investment away from higher funnel channels to lower-funnel. Nonetheless, results from the models 
suggest that online channels were more effective in explaining the variance of the number of 
participations, which were a proxy to sales. 
To managers, this thesis highlights that there are factors specific to their own campaigns that 
influence the media mix models, which they must consider and, if possible, control for. One factor is 
the selection biases, such as ad targeting that may arise from using the paid search channel or 
remarketing tactics, seasonality or the purchase funnel effects bias that undermines the contribution 
of higher-funnel channels like TV, which generates awareness in the target audience. Therefore, 
companies should assess which of these biases might have a bigger influence on their results and 
design their models accordingly. 
Data limitations are the most common constraint for marketing mix modeling. In this case, we did 
not have access to sales and media spend historical data. Therefore, it was not possible to 
understand what the uplift in sales caused by the promotion was, as well as to verify the impact of 
the promotion on items that were eligible to participate in the promotion, versus the items that were 
not. Also, we were not able to reduce the bias from the paid search channel because we lacked the 
search query data necessary to control for it and improve the accuracy of the models. 
Moreover, this project is not the ultimate solution for the  company   ù marketing measurement 
challenges but rather informs its next initiatives. It describes the state of the art in marketing mix 
modeling, reveals the limitations of the models developed and suggests ways to improve future

This study aimed to understand how a hotel website  quality may affect online

leisure and business travellers. Previous studies concluded that these two groups have 
different travelling goals and requirements, consequently influencing their travelling 
decisions. The main goal is to find whether the two groups are influenced by the same factors 
when looking for a hotel online, which is the most important factor that can impact a 
consumer's decision. Considering that studies on the development and effectiveness of 
hotel websites are scarce, this study explores and expands on this topic, thus contributing 
to future research. 
Since the website quality is a combination of usability and functionality, both factors 
will be considered in this study. The data collection method was an inquiry to 235 respondents 
who have travelled in the last 12 months and booked a hotel through the website. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS. 
We concluded that both groups are affected by different aspects. However, regarding 
the hotel quality (usability/functionality), both groups considered that functionality has a 
significant impact on the online booking intention. This study aims to help hotel managers

health conditions, and in recognition of challenges faced by lay consumers with finding, understanding, 
and acting on health information sourced online. Although there are already some studies that focus 
on a more qualitative approach, it is still necessary to understand this type of behaviour through a 
quantitative approach, i.e., studies that focus on the quantification prevalence and the pattern of 
information related with health searched online in Portugal. This study aimed to investigate the use of 
Internet for searching information on medicines and diseases, establishing the following objectives

where and what type of health information search on the Internet; the association between the uses 
of the Internet for health information with socio-demographic characteristics; and the 
needs/behaviours of the users regarding online health information about prescription medicines. We 
carried out an anonymous survey design online to collect data, among the active Portuguese 
population. The survey was carried out from May to June of 2019, and its diffusion was made through 
social media channels. A convenience sample of 288 people of active Portuguese population 
completed the questionnaire. The total of respondents (288), 186 (64,4%) participants were women 
and 102 (35,4%) men. One hundred per cent of the respondents have searched health information 
online; however, 7,6% (others) of them does not seek any search options available for selection on the 
survey. Highlight that 62.3% select information on diseases and medications, 38,0% of respondents 
have, at some point, sought information about a specific disease or medical problem. In the group of 
respondents, there were a similar number of people searching for a therapeutical indication for 
medicines (28,2%) and those who searched for the secondary effects of medicines (25,5%). The 
majority of respondents, 190 (66.0%), said they did not discuss the information they sought online with 
their health care providers, while only 98 respondents (34.0%) discussed this information with their 
health care professionals. Among the studied population, 80.6% would like to have more information 
available on ethical medication and 74,1% find it useful to have more information available in 
advertising format about ethical medicines. The largest search engine was Google (98.2%), but other 
platforms are were used simultaneously namely Infarmed website. There is a growing demand for 
health information on the internet, which is in line with trends in other countries of the world. The 
studied population shows an apparent concern for their health (with the most search topic being 
""Diseases""), but there is still much concern and doubts about drug therapy, especially that prescribed 
by the doctor. This finding reveals that the information they get in face-to-face consultations or 
medicine information leaflets is scarce for an increasingly curious and informed audience on this 
subject. Further, research on any of these topics is not discussed later with their healthcare 
professional. For this reason, we can conclude the importance of providing, accessing and changing 
language, either by health care professionals or by the pharmaceutical industry, in order to guarantee 
and promote a better and more reliable health information for the general population.

Business intelligence systems (hereinafter: BIS) have become significantly important in the

The proper usage of BIS can be seen as a prerequisite for business success, but these tools

by IT. However, integrating IT with business is not so simple due to several factors, namely: 
the available resources, choosing the right solution, top management support, time constraints, 
and finally achieving the proper user training and adoption. It is obviously not so wise to keep 
on waiting until all these obstacles are solved when there is a possibility of using some of the 
available resources such as Microsoft Office tools that might ease several processes of the 
business until the needed system is implemented and used. 
In a supply chain, as a supplier or a manufacturer, production usually follows a production 
plan that is typically created by the supply planning department. A production plan relies on a 
demand forecast, whereas a demand forecast usually relies on historical data, but the market 
demand changes and a forecast does not always match the demand, so whenever there is a 
change in the forecast, production plans are updated accordingly (Graves, 2011). Therefore, if 
we are looking to optimize the supply chain, it is necessary to build a strong relationship 
between the supply chain partners because their collaboration becomes vital in such a 
scenario. This collaboration means that the partners of the supply chain must share their 
information with each other (Groznik & Maslaric, 2012). Such information can be about the 
inventory stock levels of the customer towards the supplier which helps in optimizing the 
Reorder Level that is defined as  the point at which the company will reorder stock  ù (Meng, 
2006), resulting in creating more successful production plans that matches the market demand. 
However, these processes can hardly be done and managed manually, theyactually require the 
help of an IT system that is integrated with the supply chain for achieving the expected results. 
Aligning IT with the supply chain and using e-business to manage the relationship between 
suppliers and customers can lower costs, this is due to the fact that IT can contribute in 
supporting the collaboration and coordination through an easy way of information sharing 
between the partners of the supply chain (Auramo, Kauremaa, & Tanskanen, 2005). 
Moreover, using IT in a supply chain does not necessarily need to be costly or difficult to use; 
insteadspreadsheets for instance can be used for Inventory Planning that is defined as 
 figuring out what your inventory should be (not counting what you have)  ù (Estep, 2012). 
Even though using spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Office tools does not require 
purchasing an IT system, it is still considered a type of integrating IT with a business process 
that can significantly improve the supply chain."

According to the facets of the proposed concept, higher degrees relied on economical (R2= 81%) and psychological (R2= 80%) dimensions, followed by service performance (R2= 64%). In regard to negative word of mouth online, the majority of individuals remained silent. However, for the individual who did complaint in social networks platforms the psychological dimension was the pivotal trigger (p < 0.01). Albeit the higher levels of perceived loss related to the incident as well many premises in literature, brand equity dimensions remained intact (p > 0.05)."

what to eat. A healthy and adequate diet, associated with regular physical activity and, in most cases, 
pharmacotherapy, are the pillars of disease control. To minimise patient noncompliance, the goal is to 
use Patient Relationship Management (PRM), which allows planning in a systematic and skilled 
manner, enhancing decision making, as well as delegation and control of tasks. Many hospitals have 
already recognised the use of the best practice in PRM practices, which has enabled them to deal more 
effectively and efficiently with the entire healthcare process by responding directly to patients' needs 
and experiences throughout the assistance process. Objectives: The main objective of this project is 
to find strategies that support the Win-Win model (patient, institution) to understand the importance 
of PRM associated with a specific nutritional protocol in adherence to therapy, and whether it is 
associated with effective health gains. Methodology and Sample: Epidemiological and interventional 
research study in a convenience sample of all type 2 diabetes outpatients followed in the external 
diabetes consultation within the time frame established for the study and who agreed to participate 
and use the proposed tools. The study took place at the Garcia de Orta Hospital, E.P.E., during the 
period between April and June 2019, in the Diabetes medical appointment. It was used the Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics), version 21 IBM. The results are considered significant 
at a 5% significance level. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the changes in the different 
parameters mentioned in the questionnaires, as well as the variation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 
weight and BMI. To compare the groups CG and IG we used the Mann-Whitney U test. To compare 
weight and BMI between the two groups, the independent samples test was used, since the 
assumption of normality of data in BMI categories is not verified. To compare the parameters between 
two moments, we used the Wilcoxon test. Results: This study included 62 type 2 diabetes outpatients 
who were admitted for nutritional therapy through the Endocrinology service in Garcia de Orta 
Hospital, E.P.E.: 39 men and 23 women, with ages ranging between 32-82 years (51 patients ? 50 years old) and a mean age of 59 years (SD=11.18). Patients were randomly divided into two groups using the 
envelope method: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). Of the total sample (n = 62), BMI 
ranged between 21.17 and 48.56 kg/m2, with a mean value of 32 kg/m2. Weight was assessed in 62 
patients, ranging from 52-143 kg. It was found a mean HbA1c of 9  ± 0.4g / L, with values ranging from 
5.6 to 13.9 g/L. Regarding groups evolution, after six weeks, the CG between T0 and T2 had a variation 
between 3-6% of their BMI, variation between a 9% loss in body weight and a 6% increase of their 
weight and a variation between a 3.2g/L decrease and a 2g/L increase in HbA1c. For the IG, the BMI 
between T0 and T2 had a variation between 1-9%, all patients lost a total of weight ranging from 1-9% 
and none of the patients had an increase in HbA1c value. The decrease in this value ranged from 0-7 
g/L. Conclusions: The use of a nutritional protocol that combines a regular and adapted nutritional 
therapy, accompanied by a digital tool, boosted health gains in the group of diabetics who had this 
follow-up."

With so many similar products
and services available to the customer, it is necessary to provide customers with desirable
experiences, so that the brands stand out against their competitors.
One way to do this is to build a brand with an experiential concept, because consumers are
increasingly demanding, looking for experiences that help them to improve their behavior,
habits and lifestyle by following a certain set of trends. A distinctive experience can, in certain
businesses, be considered a strength for the brands, and can even be considered a competitive
advantage, since customers nowadays are already expecting to receive something beyond what
they would normally receive, and start looking for the experiential factor.
Providing positive experiences to consumers and creating interaction with them, a brand can
create added value, which results in greater satisfaction. This way, consumers feel as
participatory part, creating some affinity and empathy with the brand.
Thus, it will be of interest for brands to choose to implement Experiential Marketing campaigns
as an alternative to traditional and mass communication, as this is more direct, sensory and
much more emotional, serving as a relational base so that there is more consumer retention and
collection of new costumers. This will be advantageous because, in moments of indecision,
customers will have a preferred choice for the brand which they feel related to.
Considering these aspects and the society we live in today, the habits, tastes and new trends,
was the student  interest to focus this thesis in Experiential Marketing- So that, the entire
report is centered on this theme. However, during the internship for the writing of this thesis,
other activities and works, related to other thematic, were developed in order to support the

However, although it is believed that the higher the level of BPM maturity the greater the success of the organization, experience shows that this relationship is not always possible to prove. 
The purpose of this study is to help clarify the relationship between the level of BPM maturity and the success of an organization. This was done through the implementation of a case study-based research within a global company that has an operation in Portugal, focusing on the shared services organization. 
An analysis of the existing BPM maturity models and its level of coverage of BPM core areas was conducted as a way to select the most suitable BPM maturity model to conduct the assessment of the current BPM maturity level of the organization. It was also established a framework to characterize the success of an organization. These two inputs, along with information gathered to understand process improvements that were implemented and its impact in the organization, were the basis for conducting the research. 
Results show a successful organization, with a high maturity level according to the BPM OMG maturity model, that has been investing in continually improving its processes with a strong focus on digital transformation. The identified benefits from a high level of BPM maturity, namely the improved productivity, cost reduction, error & risk prevention, higher agility, employee upskilling and knowledge retention, were shown to have a positive influence in the majority of the dimensions used to characterize the success of the organization."

Although the innovation and the decrease of development time provided by these techniques, companies have perceived that quality is a differentiated factor and feel the urge to maintain the quality of their software to stand out from the competitors. At this point CMMI is presented as a reference model that contains a set of practices which lead to the maturity of organizations with focus on the improvement of organization processes and reduction of processes risk of failure increasing quality. In contrast with Agile, that puts individuals and their interactions in higher importance than processes and tools and where being adaptable to changes is more important than following strictly what was planned, CMMI it is a strict traditional approach that implies extensive formalism and focus on the processes. Derived of those apparent opposite beliefs, Agile development methods and CMMI best practices are frequently perceived to be at odds with each other. There is a great discussion about CMMI ability to be Agile and Agile methods to adapt to CMMI requirements without losing agility. This study aims to map CMMI for development process areas to Agile best practices to help in the understanding of the compatibilities and incompatibilities regarding the integration of CMMI and Agile. That will guide companies into the successful integration of Agile and maturity models together taking full advantage of their capabilities leading to enhanced software development. With the integration of those two approaches it is expected that Agile practices can help mature organizations to become more flexible, and CMMI could help Agile organizations to increase processes quality, fulfilling their goals and having their competitiveness sustained."

Several common problems of democracies will be identified, analyzed and paired with relevant information systems platforms or solutions resulting in a conceptual framework that nations can use to improve their democratic processes. Areas identified as relevant for the study are direct democracy using existing technological solutions, collaborative democracy, which would allow citizens to increase participation in the creation of laws, the allocation of budgets and online voting. Although it might not be possible to provide an exhaustive listing of all existing solution, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the information systems field, several existing solutions already provide interesting opportunities for the improvement of current democratic processes and if there was a wider adoption of these technologies it would improve the participation of citizens and reduce the increasing percentage of alienated citizens that abstain from taking part in the democratic process of their countries."

Such systems are not fitting perfectly into the businesses where they are employed (not providing all desired outcomes as they are expected by the creators and users of the system). There are three main areas where critical problems can arise in the process of information systems development: modelling, managing, and maintaining information systems. Once an architecture of the system is designed and implemented, the organization faces several problems in maintaining it. 
It is important to notice that, most of the time, people do not approach ISs problems in a systemic thinking way, but instead in a reductionist way. Which means that no one trying to understand all the interactions between components of the system, which may lead to very interesting and useful findings when studied properly. But the information system it  just a system, sometimes very complex and monolithic, but it  still just a system. 
In this work, Viable System Model will be used to help solve problems described above. The goal of this work is to apply VSM to the Information artifacts to take advantage of all benefits VSM offers. The main outcome from this work will be an architecture for Viable Information System. Systems thinking area will be taken as a basis for the development of the ideas presented in this dissertation. 
We are proposing a new architecture for modern organizations to use, to take advantage of benefits that VSM must offer. Namely: understanding of complexity, resilience to change, survival to an external environment and ability to exist independently of its external environment. 
Given that Information System is a system, and, so, obeys laws of general system theory, we could take advantage of using the  Viable System Model  ù architecture."

It is important to realize that the context in which they are inserted and how much they are used will dictate their success within the organization and, possibly, its growth. In order to have visibility within an organization, a BI tool must be able to fulfill what it promises to do and, for that, it is necessary to have the appropriate professionals and a technological and/or applicational infrastructure that adequately supports the system. BI can help in decision-making processes, by converting complex data, from different sources, into reports that are simple and quick to understand, providing the user who consults them with a more sustained decision-making process. It was possible to verify not only what is the construction and architecture of a BI system, but also what its capabilities, interactivity and fit into the business are. It was verified what types of users exist and what their functions are within the BI structure. Among the various trends and articles available, some were chosen to analyze in a little more detail. This analysis will verify the framework and context within the organization and BI systems, as well as its technical and functional composition. What advantages these tools would bring to organizations were discussed, and the main challenges they would have to face. In addition, a collection of some tools available on the market was made. SSBI has had a special importance, assuming that it has more and more the ability to bring users closer to BI tools, demystifying the idea that BI is unique to IT. These users are not only able to have more capabilities and autonomy, they are also part of the SSBI system itself, contributing and continuously improving in various ways. There are also several types of users, ranging from users who just want information in a simple and fast way, to more enthusiastic and technically advanced users, who want to use the full potential that SSBI gives them to achieve more complex and comprehensive analyses. It is important to understand where SSBI fits into the traditional BI system, and where it can contribute to improving the company's business."

what IoT is and half of them declare to use IoT technologies in their hotels, and the level of
customer satisfaction is very positive.
Taking into account the results obtained in the filter questions, 3 groups of respondents were
differentiated by their choice in: hotels that use IoT, hotels that intend to use IoT and hotels that
do not intend to use IoT. These groups were created with the objective of segmenting the

Though largely dismissed when applied to biological organisms, this theory found its place in a young discipline called Artificial Life. Based on the two abstract models of Darwinian and Lamarckian evolutionary theories built using neural networks and genetic algorithms, this research aims to present a notion of the potential impact of implementation of Lamarckian knowledge inheritance across disciplines. In order to obtain our results, we conducted a focus group discussion between experts in biology, computer science and philosophy, and used their opinions as qualitative data in our research. As a result of completing the above procedure, we have found some implications of such implementation in each mentioned discipline. In synthetic biology, this means that we would engineer organisms precisely up to our specific needs. At the moment, we can think of better drugs, greener fuels and dramatic changes in chemical industry. In computer science, Lamarckian evolutionary algorithms have been used for quite some years, and quite successfully. However, their application in strong ALife can only be approximated based on the existing roadmaps of futurists. In philosophy, creating artificial life seems consistent with nature and even God, if there is one. At the same time, this implementation may contradict the concept of free will, which is defined as the capacity for an agent to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. This study has certain limitations, which means that larger focus group and more prepared participants would provide more precise results."

With several different media and entertainment companies claiming lost profits due to digital piracy, this master thesis was created to deliberate whether companies have a right to feel damaged by illegal activities related with their content, more specifically TV-shows, the motives leading to this behavior, and if this influences the subscription of online video bundling services such as Netflix for people who access this content illegally via for example Torrent communities. We address these questions by gathering information from various legitimate sources regarding current TV-show business models (Mirrlees 2013) (Masouras 2015), the way pirates  access and visualize copyrighted content and by inquiring said pirates about their purchase intentions regarding services like Netflix. 
In order to do this, an online survey was created and shared on social media as well as in popular torrent websites, targeting people that incur or had incurred in illegal downloading of video content. We use a variation of the popular Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to gather the data regarding pirates  intentions of subscribing an online video bundling service. 
While some of the chosen variables revealed themselves to be non-significant contrary to what was firstly believed, we were able to identify Perceived Convenience, Price, Perceived Value and Morals and Ethics as the most influential factors that users contemplate when considering adopting an online video bundling service. 
This master thesis is therefore an addition to the current academic literature that depicts media consumption when users have an illegal free option to choose from. Adding the fact that this research focus specifically in the TV-Show industry ( something that has been majorly overlooked so far), we hope that the studios and related media personnel will understand what is actually valued by these type of consumers so that in the future they can offer higher value in order to capture these potential customers."

be discovered and because it can be transformed into real-time information through BI tools to 
support decision making. 
So, it is crucial to have a DW architecture that stores all the business data of an organization in a 
central repository to be accessible for all end-users, allowing them to query the data for reporting. 
When we want to design a DW, the most common approach used is the Star Schema, created by 
Kimball; however, the costs of maintenance and the re-design of the model, when the business 
requirements and business processes change, or even when the model needs to be incremented are 
very high and have a significant impact on the whole structure. 
For that reason, a Data Vault approach invented by Dan Linstedt emerged, which brings a 
methodology more oriented to auditability, traceability, and agility of the data, which rapidly adapts 
to the changes of the business rules and requirements, while handling large amounts of data. 
Therefore, this hybrid modus operandi combines the best of 3NF and Star schema, being flexible, 
scalable, consistent, whereupon the costs of implementation and maintenance become reduced, 
without the need to modify all the model structure, allowing increment building of new business 
processes and requirements. 
However, as it is still recent, the Data Vault approach has limitations compared to Star Schema, 
requiring many associations to access and execute ad-hoc queries, which makes end-user access to 
the model difficult. Consequently, the model has low performance, and more storage is required due 
to denormalization. 
Although both are competitors, when we refer to building an EDW capable of providing a central 
view of all business, the Star Schema and Data Vault 2.0 approaches complement each other 
according to Data Vault Architecture. On the top of the Data Vault, in the information delivery layer, 
as the Data Vault cannot be accessed for end-users, Data Marts are created using Star Schemas or 
OLAP cubes to apply BI tools to perform reports for organizational decision-making. 
So, briefly, the purpose of this Dissertation is, through a case study, to compare the Star Schema 
model with the Data Vault 2.0 Ensemble model. Also, to demonstrate the limitations of Data Vault 
2.0 studied and present an optimized way of designing a Data Vault 2.0 model, reducing the joins 
required to query the data, minimizing the complexity of the model, and allowing users to access 
directly to the data, instead of creating Data Marts."

This paper looks into the importance of Knowledge Management and analyses the impact that Knowledge Management Systems have on organizational effectiveness and ultimately, innovation. 
Many manufacturing companies from the Balkan region value the traditional way of operating. They remain to have hierahcy, centralized decision making and are seen to adapt to the technological changes on a slower rate when compared to other regions of Europe. Many of them have non-serial manufacturing. Often, due to the size of the country of origin of the individual organization, the only way to stay in business is by having tailored production. This increases the need for Knowledge Management. 
The purpose of this research is to get a better perspective on how Knowledge Management is embraced in manufacturing companies in order to see how information technology can help in the future. 
Data were collected with the use of an online survey sent to organizations. In order to obtain reliable data on the research and to have a more realistic view of the processes of knowledge management, this research includes organizations with different number of employees and different years of existence. 
Despite still having a centralized decision making and a more traditional organizational environment with noticeable hierarchy, manufacturing organizations in the Balkan Region today strive for improvement and have a high level of recognition for the need of Knowledge Management, according to the results from the analysis."

Then, a benchmarking is presented as a means to select a series of indicators that can efficiently capture the performance of the smart city. These indicators will feed the dashboards that will permit to see Cascais as visualized facts, changing the way how managers and citizens know their municipality.

predictive model for an airline pricing department. For this, a dataset containing the information
related to the TAP Salvador-Lisbon route was considered. The variables identified by this type of
predictive model as the most determinant for the price paid for the tickets, were the moment of
purchase (measured as the number of days before departure of being flight), the point of sale and
the number of days of the ticket issued. This outcome corresponds to TAP's empirical business
knowledge from the analyst. A clustering analysis of the route customers was also carried out to
discover some behavioral patterns that support the decision making of the dimensions to be used.
We can verify that the Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques could be used to gain a better
knowledge of the business of the company, by complementing the existing mathematical models.
These techniques allow us to describe the expected behavior of demand with a greater wealth of
information, leading to a maximization of the revenue. With the information gained by using these
techniques on the Salvador-Lisbon route, we were able to name which of the 11 metrics/dimensions
currently used (with the methodology ""Bayesian Forecasting"" - Guillotine) are more important and
will give the company greater benefits.
Thus, one can manipulate and give greater emphasis, in daily activities, to those dimensions that,
according to the results obtained by SAS, have a greater preponderance in the definition of demand.
These metrics/dimensions are the ones used by the analysts operating in the Pricing & Demand area.
We believe that the analysis of the results obtained by the models used in this work provides an
added value and a fundamental support for the daily decision-making activities. This allows to
maximize the revenue and to increase the matching between the adequacy of the offer and the
needs of the clients."

The Digital World has been developing a massive vehicle for the consumer and generated a lot of communication between customers and brands. In these contexts, it is urgent to define and make adjustments to the type of communication brands establish with their target audiences. 
The purpose of this research is to understand the impact of influencers on their followers decisions such as the perception, purchase intention, liking/disliking of the product and others, introducing the theory of the Big Two that describes social perceptions as being driven by two major dimensions   Agentic and Communal, as formulated by (Bakan, 1966). The present study is a confirmatory research based on quantitative data collected by means of an online survey with 266 active Instagram users who follow at least one influencer on the platform. The main hypotheses tested in this research are: H1a: Micro-Influencers have a more positive impact on purchase intention and liking than macro-influencers. H1b: A product sponsored by micro-Influencers is perceived as having a better fit with the followers than by macro-influencers. H1c: Micro-Influencers have more communal traits and less agentic traits when compared to macro-influencers. H2: Influencers from the communal category (that is, Lifestyle and Volunteering) are evaluated more positively for communal than agentic traits, whereas agentic influencers (category CEO and Fitness&Gym influencers) are evaluated more positively for agentic than communal traits. H3: Communal micro-influencers are evaluated more positively than communal macro-influencers, whereas agentic micro-influencers are evaluated worse than agentic macro-influencers. 
At the end of the research, the results show a higher involvement of Communal influencers and a significant impact on the followers when compared to Agentic influencers. Also, micro-influencers have a more positive impact on purchase intentions when sponsoring products or services than macro-influencers. The products sponsored by micro-influencers are perceived by their followers as having a better fit with them and the target audience likes the micro-influencers more than macro-influencers.

healthcare systems is substantial. The current pharmacovigilance method is time-consuming, 
incomplete and prone to data loss. Also, due to characteristics inherent to the reporting process, a 
great portion of ADRs are never reported. Social media (SM) data, due to its volume and immediacy, 
shows promise for a patient centered way of reporting, and has received increasing attention over 
the last few years. 
Objectives/Methodology: In this research project the author proposes to evaluate how can ADR 
automatic detection from social media contribute for pharmacovigilance, through a systematic 
literature review. The review included articles published over the last five years, accounting to 33 
publications that were retrieved and reviewed in detail. 
Discussion: Several aspects have proven to be critical when developing SM based ADR mining - the 
main purpose of the analysis (detection of posts containing ADRs and the extraction of specific ADRdrug 
pairs), the approach (lexicon or machine learning based), and the type of platform used (healthfocused 
or general use). The studies have shown a prevalence of machine learning (ML) based 
approaches, from which supervised learning is the most popular method, despite the rising trend 
against the need for costly and time-consuming annotation of data. Mixed approaches have often 
been used as they seem to derive better performance, whether in combining data sources from 
general platforms and disease forums, or using distinct sources of annotated data sets, such as 
biomedical corpus to increase algorithms strength, and even the combination of ML approaches with 
lexicon based features. 
Conclusions/Limitations: The end goal of ADR mining from social media is to be able to identify drugs 
that are either frequently related to ADRs, or those that are associated with previously unknown 
ADRs. Combining data from multiple sources will contribute to prevent the impact of serious or 
previously unknown ADRs, focusing on the issues most pertinent to patients, and will provide a 
broader safety profile of any medication, with benefits for patients, health systems, companies and 
regulatory agencies. SM data comes with its specificities (informal language, semantic confusion and 
ambiguity) that lead to analysis hurdles; hence the method and approach used must be adapted to 
the purpose of investigation and resources available. Norms and agreed practices to guide these 
efforts are needed, considering ethical issues, data quality and governance. The progress in 
information technology and the need to consider patient experience should motivate future research 
on social media surveillance for complementing conventional pharmacovigilance with patient centric 
and real time ways of reporting."

Whenever prediction deals with time-series data, it can be designated as forecasting. 
The electricity spot prices (ESP) represent the result of the market bidding prices outcome, in the electric wholesale market. Predicting these prices is an important and impactful task for market participants, like producers, consumers and retailers, since the principal objective for such players is to achieve the lowest cost in comparison with competitors. ESP play a huge role in energy market  decision making. It is important both for developing proper bidding strategies as well as for making conscient and sustainable investment decisions (Keynia & Heydari, 2019). Additionally, it impacts the decision of the technologies to use, for example, choosing between renewable energy generators or classic gas turbines. Furthermore, the topic of electricity prices forecasting is extremely relevant for both developed and developing countries. Developed countries search for their economic prospect  improvement. Electric energy efficiency is a crucial metric for that improvement. Electric energy efficiency can decrease the electricity prices thanks to the reduction of consumption, thus decreasing the need of having new expensive power generation and diminishing the pressure on energy resources. Therefore, ESP behavior is an important factor in their economy. Regarding developing economies, which have faced problems to take the populations out of poverty, the electricity sector restructuring has been fundamental for helping increase the levels of economic development (Ebrahimian, Barmayoon, Mohammadi, & Ghadimi, 2018)."

However, it was only in the 90s that basic concepts were introduced at lower levels, such as the 2nd and 3rd educational levels (Abrantes, Serrazina & Oliveira, 1999). The deep impact in daily life made the integration of the Units of Statistics and Probability compulsory in the school curriculum. The importance given to both subjects is due to the interconnection between them and the mathematics of daily life, beside the encouragement of practices related to a critical and participative citizenship.

The didactics of Statistics leads to the development of: Communicational abilities, autonomy and solidarity; critical and accurate thinking in analysing problems; confidence in partners' reasoning; the approach must include the initiative, interest and care having in mind future decisions. Teaching should no longer be centered in routine activities where students only acquire knowledge of an instrumental type, memorizing formulas or procedures, and disregarding interpretation.

The revision of the Mathematics curriculum in the 90s was subject of further revisions in the beginning of the 21st century (M.E.DES,2000). The Mathematics of the secondary level, faced a differentiation based on the orientation of learning - general studies or technological studies and the chosen group - Maths A, Maths B and Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS).

This project intends to show the evolution measured in secondary students as they were taught several concepts and procedures associated to Statistics. Simultaneously there is the interest to point out the concepts which were easy to the students and those that presented more difficulties to them.

The methodology adopted in this study was based on a set of procedures that describe the information obtained from the data. Posteriorly, the relation among the several concepts was analysed and associations were found among them. The data was grouped in four distinct sets: The previous moments comprising the questionnaires that preceded the classes; the three first tests evaluation forms in which the intervenients from the sample participated and where partial tests were made; the fourth and fifth test -evaluation forms made by the students below average regarding the partial tests.

From the results gathered in this study it was possible to conclude that there was a positive evolution in the learning of the unit. As the evolution is progressive in the approach and application of some concepts and regressive or less positive for others, it allows the deduction that a grater evolution is not possible due to the lack of willingness in understanding facts that are part of our lives. Regarding the learning of Maths, the students prefer the mechanization of procedures and calculus instead of using cognitive and logic mechanisms to interpret a situation."

correction. The hierarchical Bayesian model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie (1991) was
used to model the data, adding age and body mass index as covariates to the model. The
review of the study design and the recalculation of the weights was performed using the R software, package  urvey , and Bayesian analysis through WinBugs.
The results of this study demonstrate that the use of Bayesian models are a better choice for
the estimation of relative risk values and prevalence of the disease. However, the use of covariates did not result in a considerable improvement for the estimates precision, contrary to what one would expect. We conclude that the prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation has significant regional
variations, NUTS III level, which should not be undervalued in determining public health policy
to control the disease."

Considering this premises, companies need to innovate and to overcome the traditional way of doing
commerce, not being enough anymore having good products, it is necessary to engage customers
into new experiences and offer more innovative and convenient solution through multiple channels.
Consumers look for transparency and proximity beyond the relationship with the vendors, they want

Post-acquisition integration, according to some authors, is one of the critical phases of every strategic acquisition and determines the outcome of the whole acquisition. Researchers have found out that as much as one half to two-thirds of mergers and acquisitions are economically unsuccessful. Main contributing factors are attributed to late and inadequate execution of the post-acquisition. Although much has been written regarding the critical factors to successful integration after a merger or acquisition, very little research has focused on the associated risk management and its mitigation. To fill this shortage, the objective of the present dissertation is to identify and study the problems at procedure level in a post-acquisition process, thus contributing to operational risks and provide a systematised information support to assist organisations in making decisions regarding operational risk management in post-acquisition financial integration processes. The research methodology used is based on the literature review and the conduct of a case study focused on an acquisition carried by a multinational healthcare company. In the case study, interviews were carried out with professionals from the company directly involved in the finance integration of the acquired company. Based on the results of the interviews and articulating them with the theoretical assumptions presented in the literature review, a matrix of operational risk management in finance integration process was then constructed, which identifies the main risk factors and the risks associated, controls, mitigation measures and impacts associated with each factor."

A survey among the compilers of Balance of Payments Accounts was conducted, asking for their opinions on the potential causes of, and remedies for Net Errors and Omissions. The main conclusions are; that there are cases where there are evidences of systematic behavior of the Net Errors and Omissions, which can indicate a potential for improvement. Financial Account items seem to be more subjected to revisions than those of the Current Account and Capital Account items.

Over the course of time, several research fields have focused on the study of this subject, in order to
unravel innovative ways of examining the information, making it possible to better understand the
factors associated with crime, and find solutions to prevent and address this issue. The subject of
criminality, like many others, is strongly related with territorial distribution and therefore, it may be
well characterized by a geographical assessment. Thus, crime monitoring through geographic
information analysis tools stands as an important contribution to the study of crime. This study
explores the spatial distribution of crime against property in mainland Portugal, with the primary goal
of investigating which demographic and socioeconomic factors may be associated with this problem
in each municipality. For this purpose, Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, exploratory analysis
techniques, descriptive statistics, and spatial modelling have been applied. An initial exploratory
analysis identified the existence of autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity in the rate of crimes
against property, thus supporting the use of spatial regression models. Hence, Poisson regression
models were applied and compared, namely the global model, the local GWPR model   Geographically
Weighted Poisson Regression  , and the semi-parametric GWPR model. The model that revealed a
better fit to the data was the GWPR model, with eight explanatory variables: Purchasing power per
capita; Rate of young resident population; Retention and dropout rates in basic education; Gross
school enrollment rate; Average number of households in a classical family; Rate of RMG and RSI
beneficiaries; Unemployment rate; Ratio of foreign population. The model presents a better fit in the
municipalities on the metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto. The results show that the correlation
degree between each of the independent variables and the crimes against property varies across the
territory. The aim of this investigation is to potentially improve the understanding of the crime problem
in mainland Portugal, given that the results allow to identify the most relevant demographic and
socioeconomic factors in each municipality."

They did not show any gain at the level of the Lift curves, which points to a behavior identical to a random decision. By applying the Boosting technique - in order to balance negative and positive cases - it was possible for us to develop three models: a Decision Tree; a Neural Network and a Probit (Error Rates in the order of 36-45%).

35 years with two relevant facts: the public sector has progressed with improvement in
all relevant OECD indicators; the private sector has been widened and reinforced.
In this framework, it is important to understand how patient  intention and behavior
are built, so health care organizations in both sectors (public and private) can improve
their health care provision (particularly in health care marketing), invest and develop
those areas that might become sustainable competitive advantages.
The most established theory of social psychology explaining human behavior will
be applied: Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Within this conceptual approach,
attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavior control, habit and
past experience evaluation (satisfaction on the private and public sectors) will be
analyzed in explaining the intention to go to the private sector.
As the health care system is not homogeneous across the private and public sectors,
five models will be tested in the areas that have been identified with distinct supplies:
general practice, specialist consultation, emergency, ambulatory surgery and
hospitalization.
Design/methodology/approach   349 people completed a survey questionnaire that
measured the constructs of the TPB. Factor analysis and hierarchical multiple linear
regressions were used to test the model.
Findings   The results show that the models explained between 63% and 80% of
the intention to go to the private sector. Attitude, subjective norm and habit were always
significant predictors of intention in all models, past experiences evaluation
(satisfaction) in the private sector was not.
Originality/value   This study contributes to understand intentions and behavior of
patients that chose the private sector, instead of the public. It is a new applicability and
extension of the TPB."

There are several types of incidents depending on the type of service and the context in which they occur, but all cause changes in customer behavior that may or may not be beneficial to the company. Thus, to guarantee the permanence of customers as such, companies want loyal and satisfied customers to spread the word (positive), and for that they have to be aware of these same customers and to foresee, in a certain way, the reasons for a possible abandonment. Critical incidents can be defined according to the situation to which they refer, however they end up falling into two large groups ñ Positive or Negative. Basically, they are events, moments, experiences that occur during the customer-company relationship and can change consumer behavior. It is the critical negative incidents that have the greatest effect on customer trust, satisfaction and loyalty having the greatest impact on satisfaction. While positive critical incidents foster customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and purchase intent, negative critical incidents affect consumer behavior and lead to consumer complaints, reduced willingness to be a retail firm customer, and spread negative word-of-mouth behavior. The intensity and severity of an event also influence the behavior of consumers and the greater the intensity and severity of this event, the greater the harmful effects on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Despite the existence of negative critical incidents, their frequency or intensity can be mitigated in some cases by the way the company controls the situation, through positive events or recovery strategies. Basically, the important thing is that the company knows how to resolve the situation in a satisfactory manner for the customer. Furthermore, a critical incident, handled correctly, offers particularly good opportunities for the company to demonstrate that ìit's worth itî. The length of the relationship between customer and company is also influencing how a negative critical incident is perceived. A failure that occurs at the beginning of a relationship between the customer and the company will be perceived more adversely than one that occurs later in the relationship, because the consumer has fewer successful experiences in the service to be able to offset the failure. The best way to analyze critical incidents is through the Critical Incident Technique (CIT). It has been used in a wide range of studies and has proved to be quite effective, generating detailed process descriptions of why a service issue and subsequent recovery can be satisfactory or unsatisfactory. A qualitative methodology is strongly recommended, as it allows us to assess the subjectivity inherent in critical incidents and to better understand their perceived intensity."

Besides being a well-known important element to companies, the

of BI in SMEs can create the need for organizations to adapt
processes, regarding the accounting systems that hold decision

The performance of the models created from neural networks, more precisely, based on BackPropagation was compared with the logistic regression models performance. The logistic regression is a more traditional technique and usually considered as appropriated to this prevision problems. This work presents the several steps of the process of models construction, since the data preparation where unbalanced sample needed to be oversampled, to the results analysis. Since it was obtained a great number of models to be compared, the minor RMSE and the minor misclassification rate were the selection criteria's to restrict the models set in analysis. After selecting the best models, these performances were evaluated based on different statistics: lift, ROC curve and matrix of costs/profits. In conclusion, neural networks derived the best models, however, the achieved results did not present great differences comparing to logistic regression."

Due to this characteristic, the SOM is an effective method for clustering analysis via visualization. The SOM can be visualized through the output space, generally a regular two-dimensional grid of nodes, and through the input space, emphasizing the vector quantization process. Among all the strategies for visualizing the SOM, we are particularly interested in those that allow dealing with spatial dependency, linking the SOM to the geographic visualization with color. One possible approach, commonly used, is the cartographic representation of data with label colors defined from the output space of a two-dimensional SOM. However, in the particular case of geo-referenced data, it is possible to consider the use of a three-dimensional SOM for this purpose, thus adding one more dimension in the analysis. In this dissertation is presented a method for clustering geo-referenced data that integrates the visualization of both perspectives of a three dimensional SOM: linking its output space to the cartographic representation through a ordered set of colors; and exploring the use of frontiers among geo-referenced elements, computed according to the distances in the input space between their Best Matching Units."

tempted originates negative beliefs about people that buy on impulse, but also positive beliefs
about people that buy on impulse facilitate consumers being easily tempted. In order to test

This main objective of this study is to contribute for the characterization of the probability of someone being restricted from using cheques and can be classified as a first attempt for better understanding this behaviour. Having this objective in mind, two samples made available by the Banco de Portugal were worked on: one of cheque users that were restricted from using them and another of those not included in the above-mentioned list. 
The methodology is based on the estimation of a model with a binary dependent variable-probit. Additionally, the Bayes's theorem was used to calculate the probability of an individual being restricted from issuing cheques, conditional to each explanatory variable individually considered. The results showed that there is a set of variables that can help to explain the probability of being included in the list, namely: the bank where the client has the account, his/her age, marital status, degree of education or area of residence.

With this thesis we intend to contribute to a better understanding of the determinants of

Through multivaried exploratory analysis techniques we have defined five firm profiles in

significantly are: firm size, technological ability and investment in ICT.

To find the determinants of adoption and diffusion of ICT, we have estimated three
models:
 ?	Time period of adoption of ICT;
 ?	Global intensity ICT use in 2002;
 ?	Intensity of use of the Internet in 2002.
The explanatory variables include: obstacles to the adoption of ICT, human capital, experience, spillovers effects, firm size, and sectors of activity. The estimation of the different models presented allows us to verify that the spillovers effects (diffusion of ICT inside each sector) are the most important conductors to the adoption and diffusion of technologies. The qualification of workers and investigation and development are the most important factors in the time period of adoption and in the intensity of use of information technologies such as the Internet. As for the intensity of global adoption of the use of ICT, the most important factor is the qualification of workers. We have concluded that it is not enough to encourage the adoption of ICT in firms. There must be qualified workers that can take advantage of its use. Finally, we have verified that, as it would be expected, the experience of previous use of technologies and firm size work as a lever and lead to an opportune adoption of ICT."

Respondents were all enrolled students in the beginning of the school year and the survey results were sorted and analyzed to infer about the subsequent prevention and intervention measures to be taken by the grouping. The objective of the work is to detect if there is bullying in the schools identified above, either lived or perceived by the students during their stay in school. Thus, we present the results of a study based, on a first part, in documentary research and mere personal reflection and, subsequently, in direct observation, in the results of the surveys issued to students during the 2nd term, and in the theories analyzed in order to substantiate hypotheses advanced to the problem. The results obtained allow to validate the existence of repeated peer aggression (bullying) in the Arcozelo  elementary schools and EB2/3 Sophia de Mello Breyner, although the predisposition to aggression is constrained by the timeline in which we gathered information (winter months) . We noted that 26% of students surveyed, of which 55 children from the third year, 36 from the fourth year, 62 from the 5th year, and 45 from the sixth year, were victims of persistent aggression by one or more classmates, older, mainly male gender. The results also revealed that 16% of the school children studied were the aggressors, which is concretized in 27 children of the third year, 19 of the fourth year, 39 of the fifth year and 41 of the sixth year. The most frequently used forms of aggression were physical and verbal. The male gender is more ""victim"" but also proved to be more ""bully"". Most of the victims have been aided by one or more colleagues, but many say they have been helped by none. What concerns to the viewers, 61% of the students stated that they try to help the victim as they can, while 20% have not helped anyone but still thinking about it. Breeding data, the main causes identified for the high rate of bullying (26%) are insufficient supervision of playgrounds, limited recreational space, especially when it rains, and the lack or insufficiency of play equipment. The highest incidence of repeated peer aggression occurs in elementary school. The study results are translated into measures for intervention, highlighting the importance of available spaces and recreational equipment for the break times, enhanced oversight, greater involvement of teachers and parents in raising awareness of this issue, reform the educational project of school."

The analytical approach to the electoral results of a country suggests that different contextual effects be taken into account, namely, age differences in different regions, socio-cultural differences of the population, as well as the isolation of populations. It is, therefore, important to take into account the spatial variations in modeling electoral phenomena. This study questions the existence of spatial variations in the relationship between electoral results (legislative elections for the year 2005) of the five main Portuguese political parties (PSD, CDS, BE, PCP, PS) focusing on the differences between Municipalities in Mainland Portugal and presents, as main objectives:
1. Demonstrate the importance of using spatial statistical techniques (Geographically Weighted Regression Models) as an improvement of traditional Regression Models (OLS) in modeling phenomena based on electoral results.
2. Identify party spatial trends, at the level of municipalities in mainland Portugal, relating, for each party, the results in a particular municipality and the total number of voters in that municipality.
3. Recognize the importance of age variation, the number of blank votes and the constitution of each municipality (in relation to the number of parishes that comprise it) as determinants of the electoral results of the different political parties in the geographic areas under study."

Starting with a theoretical component, which aims to deepen the knowledge of Operational Risk, this dissertation's main objective is to analyze the case of Companhia de Seguros Generali and how it will implement Operational Risk in its structure. The ARIS application and its use in an internal Insurance Company process will be presented."

An effective solution involves, of course, information technology, through Integrated Business Management Systems (ERP). Thus, this thesis proposes to evaluate the impact that an ERP implementation process will have on an organization. An ERP is a software platform that aims to integrate the various departments of a company in a single operating system, in order to control, organize, manage and store all information efficiently. In order to conceptually support the research needed to contextualize the implementation of an ERP, a bibliographic collection on Information Systems (IS) and Information Technologies (IT) was carried out. IS is a software system that gathers, stores, processes and provides information of importance to the organization; in turn, IT is the hardware tool that supports it. The bibliographical review will serve as theoretical support for the contextualization of the case study in question, thus obtaining a solid basis for the description of the procedures to be carried out in the implementation of an ERP. In the methodological approach carried out, the research procedures will be substantiated and their feasibility demonstrated in a case study. In order to support the defined theoretical bases, the case study presents PHC Advanced as ERP software; its implementation at Flores Romeira Roma will be described in detail.

The AMP's urban system has, over the last few decades, been showing profound changes from a demographic point of view, which have proved to be distinct compared to the other large population aggregate in the country, the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (AML). The present work begins precisely by analyzing these differences, namely with regard to demographic indicators in the context of birth, mortality and migration. Next, an attempt was made to obtain a ìportraitî of the AMP region, analyzing recent demographic developments in terms of growth rates, population structure, economic, social and environmental indicators, which were summarized in an ecological and demographic characterization of the region. The investigation itself begins with an analysis of clusters on a diversified set of variables in the MPA, recorded in the last two census periods, in 1991 and 2001. The objective was to try to capture the structural changes that occurred in that period, looking for highlight the municipalities of the MPA that presented divergent growth rates, reflecting the regional inequalities of the MPA. Based on the results obtained, a prospective analysis was carried out for the AMP and for two selected type-counties: Porto and Maia. This last analysis started from a natural-based scenario, establishing hypotheses for the mortality and fertility components, being then extended to attraction and repulsion scenarios, which included the migration segment in the prospective, a determining factor in population dynamics. The prospective scenarios made it possible to outline the structure of the AMP population until 2026, also highlighting the region's regional inequalities. It is intended that the results of this investigation provide tools to support decision-making in planning and competitiveness strategies, in order to fulfill the objectives set in national and community terms for a region considered innovative, with great entrepreneurial dynamics and strong social cohesion."

The perinatal care gave an enormous contribution to the increase of the survival rates from 1998 to 2000.
With this study we intend to prove that following up premature babies and very low weight children along their childhood can be extremely important to the behavioural and cognitive development.
This study aims to compare different low birth weight children, to identify variables that most significantly contribute to psychomotor development of premature babies. We want to estimate the effect of very low birth weight in the cognition and behaviour of children. To investigate this, we applied a logit model to explain the general developmental outcomes, delays, social-behaviours and hearing and language impairments of very low birth weight children. 
Besides the weight at birth, the explanatory variables include biomedical factors (mother's age, prenatal care, sex of the baby) living arrangements (mother's education, race, social problems, family structure).
The estimation of the different presented models allows us to verify that the maternal educational and birth weight are the most significantly factors to the child's development. The sex of the babies is more related to the impairments by the age of three. The variables social problem, race and prenatal care are only important by the age of five.
The finding in this paper is that it is necessary to follow up these children up to adulthood. They have to be followed by qualified medical and educational professionals. These results have great influence in the Public Health."

For each of the campaigns that make up the marketing plan, the best customers are selected, according to the campaign objectives. These clients are selected based on information residing in large databases and often resorting to Data Mining and knowledge discovery techniques known as Database Marketing (Pinto, 2006). However, the customers to be included in each campaign are chosen taking into account only the objectives of that campaign. In this way, some customers can be selected for several campaigns offering different products. This causes some clients to be overwhelmed with multiple communications. Furthermore, other factors such as channel capacity are not considered, because each campaign is implemented in isolation without knowing the other competitors (Cohen, 2002).

The purpose of this work is to examine the main factors driving large wildfire ignition and spread in central Portugal between 2005 and 2015, contributing with empiric knowledge on their importance and variability throughout the study area. 
This research was successful at listing a comprehensive set of elements contributing to fire occurrence and at gathering data on these phenomena. Spatial cluster analysis was used to find homogeneous regions within the study area concerning the main factors influencing both fire ignition and burned area. Probit and two-part regression techniques were used to model the contribution of the different elements driving large fire occurrence and propagation. 
The main findings of this analysis confirm the presence of spatial variability in the contribution exerted by most structural factors driving large wildfire ignition and spread in central Portugal. Additionally, while vegetation characteristics appear much more relevant for fire propagation, socioeconomic elements seem to be connected to fire incidence.

Statistics is a department responsible for production, management, data processing and
dissemination of official statistical information.
Despite the existence of these two organs, the country still lacks an effective
information system, that is, a system that ensures the efficiency and effectiveness of
statistical information on births and deaths. As this information is from various sources,
like: the civil registration office, Regular Posts of Civil Registration, Mobile Brigades,
Mozambique Consulates abroad, etc. The Vital Statistics System in use still doesn't
have a capacity to homogenize the statistical data from these sources, this fact leads to
an inconsistency of information about vital events and therefore it is provided to
potential users, the general public, unreliable information, on the other hand, because of
the inconsistency of the system (to be manual) there are difficulties in access to
information about civil registration in the country, however, it takes the users having to
use secondary and informal sources.

Credit scoring models that rely on logistic regression have been the most widely applied to evaluate 
credit risk, more specifically to analyze the probability of default of a borrower when a credit contract 
initiates. However, these methods have some limitations, such as the inability to model the entire 
probabilistic structure of a process, namely, the life of a mortgage, since they essentially focus on 
binary outcomes. Thus, there is a weakness regarding the analysis and characterization of the behavior 
of borrowers over time and, consequently, a disregard of the multiple loan outcomes and the various 
transitions a borrower may face. Therefore, it hampers the understanding of the recurrence of risk 
events. A discrete-time Markov chain model is applied in order to overcome these limitations. Several 
states and transitions are considered with the purpose of perceiving a borrower  behavior and 
estimating his default risk before and after some modifications are made, along with the determinants 
of post-modification mortgage outcomes. Mortgages loans are considered in order to take a 
reasonable timeline towards a proper assessment of different loan performances. In addition to 
analyzing the impact of modifications, this work aims to identify and evaluate the main risk factors

As the financial markets grow bigger, more investors are trying to develop systematic approaches

their value in predicting and finding patterns in many subjects. When it comes to financial markets, 
Machine Learning is not a new tool. It is already widely used to predict behaviours and trends with

This dissertation aims to study the application of two Machine Learning algorithms - Genetic

historical information of the bond and on other important factors that influence its behaviour, 
extracted through the Bloomberg Portal. 
In order to analyse the quality of the two models, the results of each algorithm will be compared. An 
analysis will be presented regarding the quality of the results from both algorithms and the 
respective time cost. In the end, each model will be discussed and conclusions will be taken about

The results obtained showed that Genetic Programming can create a model with higher accuracy. 
However, Long Short-Term Memory should not be ignored because it can also point to good results. 
Regarding execution time, velocity is a problem when it comes to Genetic Programming. This 
algorithm takes more time to execute compared to LSTM. Long Short-Term Memory is considerably 
quicker to get results. In order to take the right decision about which model to choose one must keep 
in mind the priorities. In case accuracy is the priority, Genetic Programming will be the answer. 
Nevertheless, when velocity is the priority Long Short-Term Memory should be the choice."

Several methods have been proposed over the years to build recommender systems. The most popular approaches are based on collaborative filtering techniques, which leverage the similarities between consumer tastes. But the current state of the art in recommender systems is deep-learning methods, which can leverage not only item consumption data but also content, context, and user attributes. Mobile app stores generate data with Big Data properties from app consumption data, behavioral, geographic, demographic, social network and user-generated content data, which includes reviews, comments and search queries. In this dissertation, we propose a deep-learning architecture for recommender systems in mobile app stores that leverage most of these data sources. We analyze three issues related to the impact of the data sources, the impact of embedding layer pretraining and the efficiency of using Kernel methods to improve app scoring at a Big Data scale. An experiment is conducted on a Portuguese Android app store. Results suggest that models can be improved by combining structured and unstructured data. The results also suggest that embedding layer pretraining is essential to obtain good results. Some evidence is provided showing that Kernel-based methods might not be efficient when deployed in Big Data contexts."

work developed during the internship at El Corte InglÈs, Grandes ArmazÈns S.A, in Lisbon.
Organic food consumption has been increasing in Portugal over the years. Growing consumer demand
for organic products has created opportunities in organic farming and has therefore intensified
competition between organic food retailers that are focused on the same niche of organic food
consumers.
Thus, the main purpose of the report is to identify trends in organic food consumption of the El Corte
InglÈs customers. To achieve the general and specific objectives of the study four steps were defined.
In the first step were analyzed the physical store sales and the online sales of El Corte InglÈs in Lisbon
and afterwards were analyzed the main competitor  stores such as Bio Mercado, Puro Bio, MiosÛtis,
Go Natural, Amor Bio and Celeiro. In the following steps, two field studies were carried out. Firstly, a
qualitative observation study was carried out during October 2017 in the organic product area, Bio &
Natural, of El Corte InglÈs. Finally, with the results obtained in the study by observation, was conducted
a conclusive study through interviews in which were used face to face interviews in El Corte InglÈs and
an online questionnaire shared on Facebook on the official page of Bio & Natural. To analyze the results
of this study, descriptive techniques were applied, as well as the PLS-SEM methodology to create a
predictive model.
The study  results show that organic customers buy organic products mainly due to health reasons,
hence many identified trends are related to health and healthy lifestyles. However, there were also
identified trends in relation to product characteristics and purchasing and consumption habits. The
predictive model was created to predict the ""valued characteristics in an organic product"" since the
attributes of a product influence the purchase decision. In the results obtained, it was verified that
only the following purchase/consumption reasons: ""have better quality"", ""do not contain chemical
additives"" and ""help prevent diseases"" are statistically significant and therefore influence the
dependent variable and consequently the purchase decision."

Mortgage loans are one of the most popular type of loans provided by credit institutions. Like in the case of other loans, the main concern of institutions providing this type of product is a potential inability to recover the amount assigned to their clients (credit risk). In order to prevent possible losses for credit institutions resulting from clients entering in default, it is therefore crucial to study the behaviour of risky clients. This issue can be addressed through several models, namely through the multi-state Markov model, despite it constituting a more unusual approach in the context of dealing with credit risk modelling. The multi-state Markov model is a useful way of describing a process in which an individual moves through a series of states (finite number) in continuous time. By fitting this model to the loans of risky clients, it is possible to estimate the mean sojourn time in each state before a transition occurs, as well as the transition probabilities between the different states assumed by the contracts, therefore providing a relevant modelling framework for event history data. The present work relies upon 2008-13 databases from one of the biggest American companies that act in the secondary mortgage market, the Fannie Mae. Results show that with the application of the multi-state Markov model, contracts signed during 2013 are more propitious to a scenario of recovery when compared to those referring to the year 2008."

In order to achieve the objective described above, it was necessary, first, to use an imputation method to fill in missing data in the institutions' reports. The method used was the MICE (Multivariate Imputation By Chained Equations) package, which creates multiple imputations for the data through Gibbs sampling, generating plausible values ??for the data taking into account the existing relationships with the rest of the variables in the data. Subsequently, in order to analyze the data, a clustering method was used for large volumes of data, the CLARA clustering method (Clustering Large Applications) which replicates the PAM (Partition Around Medoides) method for large samples and was also used a regression that is based on a two-part model. It uses a binary model to model the probability of a positive value being observed compared to the probability of being observed a value equal to zero and an appropriate regression model to estimate a positive result. By analyzing the relationship of the overdue credit ratio with the macroprudential instruments described above in a first step, it was possible, through the CLARA method, to group all the observations with overdue credit ratio in just one cluster, without including the overdue credit ratio variable in the analysis. Only the crisis period showed an allocation of observations to the wrong cluster (in about 1.5% of observations). Once these two clusters of borrowers are formed, and regardless of the period under observation, it is possible to verify that the observations allocated to the same cluster share similar characteristics, highly influenced by macroprudential instruments, in which in one of the clusters we found observations with desirable credit granting criteria (LTI , DSTI, LTV and TAN below average) and the opposite in the other. In a second step, it was possible to see that the variables that had the greatest impact on the overdue loan ratio were the Nominal Annual Rate (TAN) of the contract, the fact that the credit is contracted in an institution classified as systemic risk, the year in that the contract has been entered into and, finally, maturity. All these variables show a positive impact on the variable under study, with the exception of the variable that concerns the fact that the credit is taken out in an institution classified as having systemic risk. The LTV and DSTI, which did not have such a strong impact on the non-performing loan ratio, also demonstrated a positive impact on the variable under study."

rate of the last elections in Portugal. Sociological and economic variables such as age, 
unemployment rate, education level and many others will be used in trying to find out if

municipality will be related to the abstention in neighboring municipalities. Therefore, the 
study also investigates if there is spatial autocorrelation in the abstention rates. 
Modeling a phenomenon like this with a simple linear regression model, estimated by 
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), will render less efficient and biased results because of the 
spatial correlation of the observations and possible spatial clustering of values. Spatial 
regression methods have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks, particularly the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). This method will take into account possible 
local influences, allowing the coefficients of the model to vary depending on the geographic 
location, possibly obtaining a more appropriate fit. Many different OLS and GWR models 
were investigated by considering different combinations of explanatory variables and 
diagnosing their results through statistical tests and goodness-of-fit measures. 
Results show that indeed the data exhibits a non-random spatial pattern, and that a GWR 
model is a better approach in modeling abstention rates, when compared to an OLS model. 
Hence, the percentage of voter turnout in a municipality is likely to be better modelled 
taking into account its geographic location."

With the advance of the Internet this technique gained strain and became a billion-dollar business. There are many different types of online financial fraud: account takeover; identity theft; chargeback; credit card transactions; etc. Online betting is one of the markets where fraud is increasing every day. 
In Portugal, the regulation of gambling and online betting was approved in April 2015. In one hand, this legislation made possible the exploration of this business in a controlled and regulated environment, but on the other hand it encouraged customers to develop new ways of fraud. Traditional data analysis used to detect fraud involved different domains such as economics, finance and law. The complexity of these investigations soon became obsolete. Being fraud an adaptive crime, different areas such as Data Mining and Machine Learning were developed to identify and prevent fraud. 
The main goal of this Project is to develop a predicting model, using a data mining approach and machine learning methods, able to identify and prevent online financial fraud on the Portuguese Betting Market, a new but already strong business."

Although its adoption provided benefits for stakeholders and to the global economy of the areas in which they are inserted, several authors and politicians have been referencing the negative externalities brought with it, such as an increase in rents and real estate prices and a decrease in hotels' revenue. However, most of the externalities pointed out, were not based on any empirical analysis. 
The aim of this study is to analyze Airbnb market within Lisbon municipality, focusing mainly the modelling spatial variation of Airbnb listings  price. For this purpose, it was employed an ordinary least square (OLS) model and a geographical weighted regression (GWR) model to identify the main factors affecting the Airbnb listings  price. The results showed that the GWR model performs better than the OLS model, and it allows assessing the local impact of the explanatory variables on the Airbnb listings  price. In conclusion, it was found that the price of the two types of Airbnb listings (entire home/apartments and private/shared rooms) are not affected by the same factors and that statistically significant differences varied across parishes within Lisbon municipality. Perhaps, there is a need to test if it is plausible to apply a unique regulatory policy considering Airbnb and Lisbon market as an aggregated concept or by Airbnb listing type and Lisbon parishes."

according to the annual ranking published by the Institute of Management Development (IMD) that
compares a country's ability to attract and retain the best talent, in the Americas the best positioned
countries were the United States (12th), Canada (13th) and Chile (46th). In Europe, the three countries

necessary to provide policymakers with information to help them develop talent retention plans for
talent. The results of this research are supported by the answers given to an online questionnaire sent
to former university students of nationalities. In this study, the main points valued by an individual
when choosing a place to live were considered.
The sample is verified by 300 students, who mostly have a degree (72.0%), as an education level, a
master's degree (22.3%), postgraduate (5.3%) and doctorate (0.3%); the participants' ages are from 18

represented gender was male (59.0%). The data used were collected through an online questionnaire
aimed at students and alumni located in different parts of the world.
In the results, it was verified that the latent variable that most explains Health and well-being is
Perception (Education) and Environment. The latent variable that most explains Motivation is Health

In Portugal, in spite of the progress achieved in the past decades, students  retention is still a problem. The phenomenon of school failure has been extensively studied throughout the world. Nevertheless, the way it is distributed across the country and the potential reasons that contribute to it being more intense in some areas than in others have not. The idea behind this project is to analyze the retention rates in middle school and in high school in the Portuguese public system, since the beginning of the decade and understand how they are distributed across the territory. The methods used were Principal Components Analysis and cluster analysis. 
The data related to potentially explanatory indicators of student failure   such as the average number of students per class, percentage of students in families who benefit from social support and the percentage of teachers with a permanent contract   were analyzed. 
The differences between the north and the south of the country are remarkable. Generally, the retention rates are much higher in the south than in the north. We also conclude that municipalities that are closer to each other have similar behaviors regarding their students  success or unsuccess in terms of retention rates. Nevertheless, there are exceptions to the rule. For example, in Algarve, S?o Br·s de  Alportel stands out as a municipality that does particularly well in a context where retention rates are relatively high. 
Lastly, in this dissertation, we zoomed in the conurbations of Lisboa and Porto, where almost one in four children was enrolled in 2015/2016. The conclusions are striking: there are schools with some of the lowest retention rates while others, sometimes right across the street, can double the percentage of retained students."

The main goal of this study is to identify socioeconomic indicators (e.g. illiteracy, unemployment, purchasing power, medical appointments by habitant, restaurants by habitant, etc.) and spatial variables (e.g. distance to health facilities) that might be associated with mortality rates caused by diseases associated to eating habits, and the municipalities where they are more determinant to these rates, in order to better understand the health status in the municipalities of mainland Portugal. The methodological framework has two main stages. In the first one, a set of socioeconomic and spatial variables are analyzed using an iterative process that applies Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to obtain different alternative linear regression models, choosing the best possible model according to multiple statistical tests and diagnostic measures. In order to deal with spatial nonstationary and to investigate local relationships, the second stage is based on a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model with the variables that were included in the best OLS model. The GWR model is also diagnosed for local multicollinearity of the explanatory variables. The Global Moran's I statistic is used to diagnose the possible existence of spatial autocorrelation of the residuals in all tested models. The accuracy of the GWR parameter estimates is assessed through the local standard errors. The selected variables in the GWR model were  Hospital response ù,  Grocery-to-convenience stores ratio ù,  Average distance to fast food restaurants per habitant ù and  2nd cycle education ù, which explain between 42% and 64% of the mortality rates variability in the municipalities.

economies, growing inequality and increasing ecological degradation. The latter may be the most 
serious of these trends. Human economic activities have reached a level that is bound to instigate 
irreversible change to the global environment, creating conditions likely to be less conducive to human 
development. The market system demand curve is distorted if inequality is sufficiently great and the 
purchasing power has a greater impact on allocation than preferences. If we attempt to internalize the 
ecological costs of essential resources into their market prices, driving up price, the best case scenario 
is that the poor reduce consumption by more than the rich, even though the rich have been the 
primary drivers of ecological degradation. The thesis focuses on the food allocation and demand curve 
distortion. Mainstream economists argue that it is impossible to objectively compare marginal utility 
across individuals, and the best we can do is equate willingness to pay with utility. However, food 
consumption is a physiological need, and it is quite possible to objectively compare the marginal utility 
it provides to different individuals. Certainly, a malnourished person gains more from additional food 
than an overfed one. A comprehensive econometric modeling of an aggregated and two-staged food 
demand systems is carried out for one hundred-seventy-seven countries. The data is retrieved from 
the 2011 round of the World Bank International Comparison Program. In the first stage, the Florida 
preference independence model is applied to the main broad groups of goods and services. In the 
second stage, a conditional demand system for food subcategories is estimated using the Florida 
Slutsky model. An Inaccuracy measure and the Stroble decomposition are used in the outliers 
detection procedure The system equations are corrected for both groupwise and scale 
heteroskedasticity. The iterated nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (ITNLSUR) is applied in the 
final estimation, while the iterated nonlinear least squares (ITNLLS) produces the initial values. The 
gauss-newton method is used to approximate the maximums of the objective functions. Expenditures 
elasticities, Slutsky own price elasticities, Frisch own price elasticities and Cournot own price elasticities 
constitute the estimate of the elasticities structure. Expenditure and marginal expenditure shares are 
the most valued direct outcome of the models. In a perfect allocation system food marginal shares 
would be equal for every country. The discrepancies shown are an indicator of the market distortion. 
A redistribution towards poorer countries would increase total utility. Even if a pareto optimum is in 
place in every economy (normally it is not), the solution captured by the model seems to be far from 
a global optimum. It is of upmost importance to know what are the implications on the real income of 
the poor if ecological thresholds are put in place through a market based mechanism. The Cournot 
elasticity estimates make evident that the poorer countries have more elastic demand curves, resulting 
primarily from the impact of increasing prices on real income, since there are no substitutes for food. 
This means that in an unequal market economy, if market based instruments are used to reduce the 
ecological degradation caused by food production, the poor will reduce consumption by a much 
greater percentage than the rich in response to price increases. Since the rich are responsible for far 
more ecological degradation than the poor, this outcome is highly perverse. This distortion is 
associated with the food shares and the marginal food shares that are higher in less affluent countries."

Most of tourism demand forecasting models are time-series and econometric based. A real-world system like tourism industry is dynamic, thus not linear. Machine Learning methods have proven to be quite suitable for non-linear modelling. These methods are part of an interdisciplinary field named  Data Mining  ù which is known by the process of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). 
The core drive of this project work is to enhance the available public sources of tourism forecast information and contribute to the tourism stakeholder  strategy in Portugal. More specifically, to develop a multivariate model to forecast international tourism demand through a Data Mining approach. The model development was constrained to publicly available data and machine learning methods. The forecasted demand variable was the nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments in Lisbon  region, one of the country  main foreign tourist destinations. 
Instead of revealing a best forecasting method or model, as most of previous research sought to, the current project aimed at building the most accurate multivariate forecasting model, based on a database with minimum data assumptions. The objectives were achieved, as the selected model (SMOReg) was successful in generalization capability. The accuracy of the produced forecasts provides some evidence of the reliability of the proposed forecasting model. If institutions and decision makers have information regarding the evolution of the explanatory variables used in this model, the impact on Lisbon  tourism demand can be assessed, even in case of an emerging recession."

To understand this phenomenon in detail, we first identified the key determinants of CC Platforms and then estimated the multiple relationships using partial least squares path modelling. The theoretical section included the dimension of consumer trust, social media and other relevant constructs along with technology acceptance theory, which further supported in developing the research model. In order to test the model, we conducted a detailed survey and validated the hypotheses. The outcome variables were sharing intention, user behaviour, trust, satisfaction, and intention to recommend. The explanation all the dependent variables was exceptionally good. In addition, we conducted a mediation analysis and found satisfaction as a mediator variable."

A qualitative analysis was carried out on the perceptions of coaches and athletes of an Elite champion volleyball team in the 2015/2016 season, with the main objective of understanding the influence of these athletes on the other elements of the team. Thus, individual interviews were carried out with all team members and a focus group was performed allowing the identification of formal leaders, coaches and captains, and informal leaders, especially task, motivational and social leaders. The main moments of action of these leaders as well as their forms of action were identified and it was possible to analyze the effect produced by them in each individual of the group. Given the difficulty in perceiving the influence of shared leadership on team performance, the respondents' results suggest that leadership distributed by coaches and athletes would optimize individual and consequently collective performance."

procedures that lead to the construction of the algorithm and also a description
of the software development. Two datasets where used to test both experimental model and ECSI model. A comparative analysis of the achieved results was
possible using other available programmes. The outputs presented no dissimilarities, which led to evaluate positively the code  performance.
Good results aside, the new program foresees the estimation of the PLS-SEM
method simply by adjusting the parameters to the user  requirements. As
an open source, it also has the advantage of being a simple and manageable

This investigation focuses on a specific marketing field, which is the green marketing, characterized by
the concern for a more ecological and conscious marketing and by a greater awareness of the social
and environmental harms that affect our society. The opportunity and willingness to extend the
subject to the Portuguese case arose due to the bibliographic review that focuses primarily on
environmental problems, the studies from other countries regarding the green marketing and the lack
of them in Portugal.
After the execution of a qualitative questionnaire to a group of 10 Portuguese people, another 210

factors on the green buying behaviour. It was also intended to outline which are the characteristics of
the consumers whose attitudes are focused on environmental preservation to oppose the

The analysis of the results, made with the help of statistical methods in SAS Enterprise Guide 7.13 and

related with everyday practices and the price and quality of green products. The Portuguese
consumers that are more likely to buy green are generally young working women, with a wage equal

perceptions of e-WOM by users of high and low involvement. There is also attention in validating the
different perceptions between comments with high and low quality and the perceived difference

consumers.
A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was carried out and it showed that the ""Involvement with

the analysis.
The factorial analysis included the following factors: Perceived influence of e-WOM; Quality of online
comments; Number of comments online; Attitude towards the product and Purchase intention. Results
showed that the amount of comments available online, as well as their quality, did not prove significant
on the intention to purchase a cosmetic product.
On the other hand, the perceived influence of e-WOM is a relevant factor in the purchasing decision
process. That is, if an online commentary transmits unknown information to the reader and reveals
positive experiences from other consumers, it creates a positive attitude towards the product which
will result in a bigger intention to purchase such products."

The companies want to know which of their customers and when are they going to churn to another provider, so that measures can be taken to retain the customers who are at risk of churning. Such measures could be in the form of incentives to the churners, but the downside is the wrong classification of a churners will cost the company a lot, especially when incentives are given to some non-churner customers. The common challenge to predict customer churn will be how to pre-process the data and which algorithm to choose, especially when the dataset is heterogeneous which is very common for telecommunication companies  datasets.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange  S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) is seen as a fear gauge and as such is normally used to hedge against big drops in market value as a form of insurance for a portfolio. This thesis extends the original Dash and Moran framework and tests new ways to use the exchange traded product associated with VIX. I study whether VIX option strategies, in specific Straddle and Strangle, can improve the risk adjusted performance of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and commodities. The study takes place between the periods of 2006 and 2013 and relies on simulations of different portfolio combinations including the main instrument (equity, bond or commodity) and a percentage invested in the VIX strategy. We find that, in general, straddle strategies are not recommended since we obtain a lower volatility and Value-at-Risk with the impact of much lower returns making it an unattractive investment for any investor. On the other hand, the strangle strategy shows improvements in the overall performance of the equity and commodities portfolios mainly in the periods during which securities prices fall and with a low allocation to the strategy (lower than 2%) and highly Out-of-the-Money."

Reverse mortgages  were  originally conceived  to  assist retirees  with  limited income, to  use their  accumulated  real wealth  to cover daily living expenses and/or pay for health  care. Considering the  low-income level  of  most  Portuguese  retirees   and  the  comparatively  high  levels  of  home ownership, the aim of this paper is to discuss the valuation  of standard  reverse mortgages  contracts in  Portugal  using  a  stochastic  approach  for  both  biometric  and  financial  risk  factors.

A stochastic mortality model  (Poisson Lee-Carter age-period model)  is used to project  future  mortality rates and to derive dynamic lifetables  projections for the Portuguese population. All these results are used to calculate the reverse mortgage  model and simulate  results in different scenarios considering changes in relevant  variables:  initial  borrower's age, initial  house price, mortality rates, borrowing ratio, loan to value percentage and interest  rate on the loan. The expected payoffs are compared and riskiness of the different scenarios is assessed using Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk."

For this purpose, an adequate selection of the fishing vessel to monitor is essential. Given the importance of a selection vessel to inspect, the developed research focused on the question of whether the fishing vessels in maritime areas under Portuguese sovereignty and jurisdiction, can be predicted by econometric/stochastic models. The answer to the research question resulted from an exploratory analysis in order to identify the conditions and characteristics of the fishing vessels classified as in violation, while identifying also the variables to be included in the predictive model. Besides, as part of the exploratory analysis, was analysed the impact of the variable rate of unemployment, as an economic indicator, in the rate of detected violations during the 2006-2015 period. Finally, the method of discriminant analysis was implemented, and it was found that the linear discriminant function, with proportional odds, is that performs best. The percentage of correct classifications were 79%, while the correct rated legal vessel was 96% and an total error rate of 21%.

If the aspiration of S?o TomÈ and PrÌncipe (STP) focuses on the development of the tourism
industry, then the needs and desires of the costumers must be addressed. The most common
technique to identify the compatibility between the tourists  needs and the destination
experience is the satisfaction of the tourists.
Considering the need for excellence in the region, the objective of the research is to measure
the level of satisfaction and loyalty of the tourists who visit STP.
The elaborated model to analyse and measure the level of satisfaction and the loyalty of
tourists consists of four steps: 1. Elaborate a questionnaire targeted at foreign tourists, based
on a theoretical model of the Tourist Satisfaction Index of STP; 2. Determine the level of
satisfaction of the tourists; 3. Identify the main variables which impact satisfaction; and 4.
Verify the relationship between satisfaction and the degree of loyalty from foreign tourists in
S?o TomÈ e PrÌncipe.
In general, the tourists who visited S?o TomÈ e PrÌncipe are satisfied with the services offered
by this destination. However, they are reluctant regarding certain aspects such as price,
recreation and leisure, commerce, tourist information and cultural activities.
The natural environment emerges as the variable with greatest impact on tourist satisfaction,
being recommended that action has to be taken on the indicators that are associated with it.
There are evidence that destination satisfaction is important for the loyalty of tourists, as
presented in similar studies (Rust and Zahorik, 1993 and Oliver, 1999)."

This research reports the findings of two studies. Study 1 includes a pretest based on hospitality professionals  interviews (Study 1 - Pretest, N = 20), and a survey for hospitality customers (Study 1 - Survey, N = 305); Study 2 uses a real dataset of a large European hotel chain (Field Study 2, N = 300,000). We reveal that employee-guest communal relationships, triggered either by interpersonal communication (Study 1) or by a satisfactory interpersonal interaction during the stay (Study 2), can affect guests  future booking cancellation behavior and intentions. 
Conversely to managerial practice and theoretical guidance, we found that communal employee-guest relationships driven by interpersonal interaction might indeed increase booking cancellation. We propose that since consumers feel closer to the service provider in a communal relationship, they feel no moral obligation or regret in canceling the booking. The findings provide support for our theoretical account, showing that perceived moral obligation and tendency-to-regret moderate the negative effect of interpersonal interaction on booking cancellations. While moral obligation reduces the negative effect of interpersonal interaction on cancellations, tendency-to-regret increases this effect. Theory and practical implications are discussed for hotel managers and marketers. By doing so, we extend previous findings on interpersonal relationships in hospitality research, showing under which conditions, interpersonal relationships between hotel employees and guests can affect booking cancellations."

Insureds may not have in the market what they really want to acquire which may encourage fraudulent actions. Traditional fraud detection methods are no longer adequately protecting institutions in a world with increasingly sophisticated fraud techniques. This work focuses on creating an artificial neural network which will learn with insurance data and evolve continuously over time, anticipating fraudulent behaviours or actors, and contribute to institutions risk protection strategies."

sulphate, bicarbonate and nitrate and other features: pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, 
electrical conductivity, hardness, ammonium, nitrite, free cyanogen and chemical oxygen 
demand, total cation sum and total anion sum. Both the Principal Components Analysis and the 
Factor Analysis revealed that the differences between water individuals are best characterized 
by four Principal Components or Factors indicating material loadings, hardness or softness 
aesthetic acceptability and lightness/sutability for human consumption. Hierarchical and Non- 
Hierarchical k-means Cluster Analysis clearly identified the presence of four distinct clusters: A,

for each cluster have been defined as such the classification achieved to acquire improved and 
detailed understanding of the general properties of the products under study. We have 
observed that HCA using WARD algorithm provided us with more realistic classification solution 
in comparison with non-hierachical k-means as the Cluster members are truly reflecting their 
group pattern in line with their chemical compositions. HCA using WARD showed that BRAND05

to be as hard waters. And BRAND09 and BRAND10 staying with DEIONIZEDWATER belonging to 
Cluster B are completely devoide of essential minerals as such seemed to be as ultra low mineral 
content type water or too soft in nature. The other folks BRAND03, BRAND04, BRAND06, 
BRAND07 and BRAND08 are also not having sufficient mineral contents so as to be very soft 
water indeed. Hence, waters belonging to Clusters A, B and C are not suitable for human 
consumption. Only two brands BRAND01 and BRAND02 staying in Cluster D appeared to be 
suitable for human consumption in every respect.The fact is the BRAND01 is produced by a 
foreign manufacturer. That means, all other local brands, except BRAND02 are essentially not 
having the appropriate quality to be drinking waters. From both PCA and FA these two brands 
BRAND01 and BRAND02 have been very well explained. These are the major outcomes of this

Regarding the book industry, research has highlighted the importance of online reviews as a reference when selecting and purchasing a book. However, the issue of what drives consumers to write online book reviews is seldom mentioned throughout the literature. This study focuses on the factors driving consumers to spread online book reviews. As a starting point, a Cheung and Lee  model on what motivates consumers to spread eWOM was analysed, and other motivations that were found to be relevant in the literature were added to said model. The data was obtained through an online questionnaire published on Facebook and Goodreads book-related groups, as well as sent to the Nova Information Management School students. From the collected data, 225 responses were considered valid and were later analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings of this study showed that sense of belonging is the motivation with the greatest impact on consumer  intention to write online book reviews, followed by venting negative feelings and desire for sharing, and, to a lesser extent, reputation. The results mentioned provide important insights that can be used both in future research and by managers in the book industry."

Most of the UTAUT2 hypotheses are supported, with performance expectancy being the strongest predictor. Openness is a significant predictor of behavioral intention, whereas for usage behavior the significant personality predictors are openness, extraversion and agreeableness. Moreover, as data was collected in Bulgaria and Portugal, a multi-group analysis revealed significant country differences.

Consequently, we have chosen to estimate the Stereotype Ordinal Regression, an ordered

measured by an ordinal variable. As expected, sex is a differentiating variable. That is, there
is sometimes that the determinants of health status have the opposite effect for men and

Many nonparametric and semi-parametric models have been proposed that do
not make such parametric model assumptions, nor do they depend on correct

Poisson regression is presented, as well as its bias, variance and assimptotic

This model, despite showing good performance, is quite heavy, due to its

Social problems in developing countries have increased significantly as a result of several factors, one of them being the lack of adequate housing. Housing is one of the basic needs that every human being seeks to satisfy; in most societies it is regarded as an elementary social necessity. The aim of this work is to analyze the housing profile in Mozambique in the period 1997-2007. Data were obtained from the last two population censuses, carried out by the National Institute of Statistics in 1997 and 2007. A descriptive quantitative statistical procedure was carried out. Only private dwellings were selected for study. The results are presented descriptively and in maps, using the Geographic Information System. We found that the majority of the population of Mozambique lived in private housing, being largely huts (69.7%). Only 1.6% of the houses were houses, 0.7% were apartments and 0.5% were precarious housing. In terms of ownership, most people live in their own homes (92.3%), 3.6% live in rented homes and 2.8% in rented homes. The predominant building materials in the walls, floor and ceiling correspond, for the most part, to the materials generally used in the construction of huts and informal dwellings, that is, 34.6% of the dwellings have walls of matted wood, 32% walls of V-block walls. adobe, 18.3% reeds/sticks, 12.3% cement, 4.9% brick blocks, and 0.9% wood. Regarding the roof coverage of private dwellings, most of them were in grass (76%), 24% in zinc sheets and 1.5% in cement. Regarding the type of pavement, it was found that 23.3% were adobe; 1.1% were in parquet and 0.9% in clay. Only 9.9% of private households had electricity; only 2.7% of homes had running water; 11.2% used spring water; 23.4% consumed water from the lake and the majority consumed water from the well (64%). Still with regard to basic services and sanitation, most of the Mozambican population lived in private houses with toilets without a flush toilet, corresponding to 6.6%, followed by those who lived in houses that only have a latrine (5.9%); and a minority lived in private dwellings with a flush toilet (3.2%). In Mozambique, the number of homes has been increasing, in line with the dynamics of population growth. However, in terms of housing conditions, changes have been slow. The hut remains the predominant traditional form of rural housing. Construction materials are still precarious and access to basic services (water and electricity) limited. This work allowed for the first time to characterize housing in Mozambique down to the district level. We leave two suggestions for future work: 1) the production of maps similar to those we are carrying out with a focus on each province and districts; 2) the use of the information disclosed to support policies on housing and the rapid improvement in the living conditions of the Mozambican population, especially in more rural areas."

The thirty-year period tries to reflect the changes that took place in Portuguese society with the April 1974 Revolution, the process of nationalization of large companies, the disappearance of large nationalized companies in the 1980s and 1990s; facts that conditioned the variability and distribution of the Barreirense population, its activity and dynamics in the municipality's territory. Barreiro has around seventy-nine thousand inhabitants, having lost around six thousand inhabitants between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, having also had a decrease of around two thousand and five hundred inhabitants between the 1981 and 1991 censuses. the Municipal Master Plan of Barreiro, approved in 1994, was conceived for a limited growth capacity of up to two hundred and ten thousand inhabitants. Population growth has led to the urbanization of rural areas, far from the city centre, implying a greater need for the creation of infrastructure. If the Municipal Master Plan of Barreiro had foreseen a programmed growth, the areas available for urbanization would be smaller and eventually close to the consolidated urban nucleus, allowing the growth of crowns around that same nucleus and possibly a revitalization and requalification of older urban areas. If the demographic growth that occurred in the last 15 years were the limit defined in the PDM of Barreiro (two hundred and ten thousand inhabitants), there would be many influences at the territorial level, implying the need for more equipment and infrastructure. However, if the ceiling defined in the Municipal Master Plan of Barreiro for population growth had been one hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, allocating a smaller area of ??the county to be urbanized, Barreiro would also be different from what it is currently, leading to a revitalization of the historic nuclei, or the cost of the urban square meter reaching very high values.
In the context presented, it was understood to elaborate a study that allows to boost knowledge of the municipality of Barreiro, identifying its problems in order to intervene advantageously in the planning and planning of the territory, contributing to the construction of a fair society and sustainable urban living ."

population ageing and lodgements is becoming an issue of greatest importance, which can be
approached at different levels.
The Portuguese population will be ageing on the next decades. According to INEStatistics Portugal, within the period 2010-2050, the number of persons older than 60 years
will increase more than 40% and reach more than 3 millions, while the population older than
75 years will have an increase of about 80%. This trend is unchangeable, although it may be
slightly contained by the increasing of births, by the slowing down of life expectancy or by
an increase of migratory flows.
The intersection of demographic and housing data, confirms that the number of lodgings
has been growing in recent years, including regions that recorded temporary population
losses.
The composition and size of families also deserve a more detailed analysis. It is possible
to say that the relationship between lodgings and inhabitants is changing due to
transformations in family structures. The number of families is increasing very quickly while
their size is being reduced.
This analysis is aiming to evaluate if the process of population ageing will have
considerable effects on Housing, clearly making a connection between increasing housing
resources and population ageing. We also intend to analyze if housing resources are
becoming more abundant, due to stronger construction dynamics than demographic
dynamics, showing in which way population ageing can have an effect on this reality. "

When searching and detecting for targets at sea, with passive (visual) or active (radar) detection systems, it is natural that the sensor and target are in motion. Detection is possible when the relative motion between the sensor and target brings them close enough so that detection occurs. The function that represents the probability of detection conditional on the distance between target and sensor is the lateral range curve. This function, ( ), represents the probability of detecting a target when the lateral range is   and the relative motion between the sensor and the target is described by a straight line. Knowledge of the lateral range curve for various combinations of sensor, target and environmental conditions, plays a key role in planning search and rescue operations at sea and in planning maritime interdiction operations. The construction of the lateral range curve requires previous knowledge of the lateral distance   between the sensor and the target, regardless the occurrence or not of a positive detection of the target. This feature makes the estimation of this curve a difficult problem, because the collection of detection data is only possible through conducting sea trials planned in advance. These planning conditions are unrealistic when we want to infer about the ability to detect a non-cooperative or hostile target. In the latter situation, only positive detection distances are known between the sensor and the target. In this work we estimate the lateral range curve and its natural parameter, the sweep width, using the Neuendorffer model and the Nth power law of detection, based on initial detection distances and not on lateral distances. The estimation of the lateral range curve is made under the two alternative models and taking into account three factors: characteristics of the target, sensor and environmental conditions. For each treatment resulting from the combinations of the levels of three factors, the performances of both models are compared by a stability criteria using resampling and partition of the data. The ultimate goal is to produce sweep width tables for all treatments resulting from the combination of the levels of the three factors mentioned above."

Coral bleaching  ù is caused by climate change due to the increase in temperature in the ocean  water which starves the organism and what remains is only its white skeleton. This is one of the biggest threats to coral reefs. This study aims to understand whether, when given information about coral bleaching specifically, people are more likely to participate in actions that prevent coral bleaching through global warming and if so, what their main motive is to do so. This is important for organizations whose goal is to protect the coral reef so that they can make more effective campaigns. A survey is conducted with questions specifically targeting these main goals and statistically analyzed before and after a passage containing facts regarding coral bleaching, to determine if there are any changes in people  standpoint. Results showed a lack of knowledge of the importance of coral reefs for human life which increases likelihood to take action against coral bleaching once reading the passage, when considering all respondents. Previous belief in cause and existence of climate change influences the likelihood to take action overall. However, Gender and Age play a role in increased awareness and likelihood to take action against coral bleaching."

occur, being the banking sector one of the major targets. However, in parallel with these new perils 
from technological growth, awareness of cyber risk is also increasing among institutions, as well as 
the search for protection and measures to fight them. Cyber insurance is one of the possible 
protection options. 
The main goal of this work is to assess the supply of cyber insurance among the banking sector 
operating in Portugal. As empirical investigations of cyber insurance applied in the country are rarely 
reported in the literature, the results are novel. 
In order to get the main goal, the research is based on a literature review where will be presented 
the  state of the art  ù of cyber insurance market in the world and in the country. In addition, an 
empirical study will be made through the application of questionnaires to ascertain the specificities 
of cyber insurance suppliers or potential suppliers in the Portuguese market, their perception of 
market evolution and knowledge about cyber risk. There is also a specific questionnaire for the 
supervisor entity in order to know its point of view about the topic in discussion. 
The main conclusions of this study relate to the fact that there is still a long way to go in the 
Portuguese insurance sector for cyber risk. The sector in the country started to be developed by 
international companies and only after that the national ones started to have more awareness on the 
subject, as mentioned by the Autoridade de Supervis?o de Seguros e Fundos de Pens?es (ASF). 
However, awareness of the issue is not the only point that leads to the underdevelopment of this 
specific insurance. The difficulties in the product underwriting process, which on the part of those 
who sell as well as those who buy, the high and variable prices, the lack of historical data and the 
information asymmetries are examples of obstacles that still have to be overcome. 
Although the cyber risk insurance sector is taking its first steps, it is believed to have a large margin of 
expansion, as has already been the case in several other countries. The creation of information 
sharing platforms on cyber incidents and the design of insurance and reinsurance products for cyber 
incidents are considered by the participant insurers as the main measures to be taken to assist this 
market development. It therefore becomes an inevitable topic to be addressed by the insurance 
sector in Portugal."

Their high volatility and lack of regulation makes these investments very risky, and even though these coins are often associated with criminal activities, an increase on the number of investors is visible every day. 
The blockchain technology, which serves as the basis for this type of coin, has also dismissed much curiosity from various technological giants and financial companies. 
Almost all major banks, big accounting firms, prominent software companies or governments already did a research related to cryptocurrencies or published a paper about it. 
Most of the published studies explain the technology behind cryptocurrencies, others calculate their volatility and the remaining ones list their main advantages and disadvantages. 
However, there was no published study that aims to understand what kind of profile these investors have and what are their motivations and expectations for the future. 
With the help of a questionnaire presented to the investors, this study concluded that there are two separate investor profiles and also understood what are their motivations and expectations for the future. 
On the other hand, through interviews with financial institutions, it was possible to see what vision regulators, private equities and corporate banking have for this new type of currency and if they consider them as a valid mean of payment."

primary objective, the creation of a tool that would provide and facilitate the means to the decision
making process concerning the Navy  land and real estate management and usage.
The system, which allows for the analysis of a common geographical environment, includes the setting of
the real estate owned by the Portuguese Navy, the modeling of the geometrical form marking the
boundaries of the military land to which some of this real estate is subject, the satellite imagery of the
surrounding areas, the district and county borders and some other basic information. The geo-spatial
integration of these information layers constitute the basis of the analytical process executed by the
people responsible for these decisions. A relational database was created, and the historical background
of these decisions was included, for a better future analysis. This was all made available in a simple
interface, accessible to all the users with some degree of responsibility in the process of evaluating the
requests for decisions concerning the civil usage of military land.
The SICA-SIGPAS is available in four formats: a workstation for editing and developing, a web environment
format, published in the Portuguese Navy  Intranet for general access, a DVD format with connection to
the published database in the mentioned Intranet and an off-line DVD format, with the database included
in the media. The first three media formats are directly connected to the published database that
receives constant updates and is regarded as the valid information container. The other media format,
even thou it receives the updated information only with new editions, has the advantage of portability.
With this tool, the process of decision concerning the requests for real estate licensing inside or in the
vicinity of military land and even the management of the Portuguese Navy  real estate became
increasingly efficient because there is added agility in the decision-making process concerning a given
request, thus reducing the response time. This increased effectiveness can also be attributed to the
centralization of the representation and the documentation to be used by all the military units involved in
the process, creating a common global impression of each different case and each situation."

in literature, both in meta-analyses studies and in country level empirical investigation. 
The analysis starts with the conventional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and continue with more 
spatially sensitive methods, namely Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and its 
semiparametric extension (SGWR). The final method, SGWR, enables the investigation of local 
variations in turnout values, simultaneously considering that its relationship with some variables

Results show that turnout is a complex process, influenced by a set of sociodemographic variables. 
While some variables affect turnout differently over the country (percentage of family cores with 
children aged less than 15, and percentage of owner-occupied houses), others affect it uniformly 
(percentage of graduated residents, percentage of classic families, and distance to Lisbon or Oporto

This thesis presents a proposal to automatically analyze data from vibrations Chapter 2 presents a review over the main concepts of maintenance, with emphasis on Condition Based Maintenance and the use of vibration analysis in this context. Following this, the planning and data collection procedure of vibration data on the selected machine is presented according a previous experiment plan. A preliminary analysis from the collected data using the global value of vibration is made. The main contribution of this thesis is the proposal of a method of analysis based on the correlations among spectra. The original vectors containing the signal spectra are transformed in characteristics vectors that can be used to characterize the health condition of the machine. We called this transformation VMV- Vibration Monitoring Vector. After this transformation, we use multidimensional scaling to visualize the machine condition in a graphic. Future work can make use of the VMV transform as input to an automatic classifier. Following, the results of this method are presented using the collected data, showing that it is a valid method. Finally, some suggestions are made for future work and to improve this methodology."

The purpose of the dictionary and BIRD Project is to provide the banks with a harmonized data model that describes precisely the data that should be extracted from the banks' internal IT systems to derive reports demanded by supervisory authorities, like the ECB. 
In this report, I will provide a basis for understanding the work undertaken in the team, focussing of the technical aspect of relational database modelling and metadata repositories and their role in big data analytical processing systems, current reporting requirements and methods used by the central banking institutions, which coincide with the processes set out by the European Banking Authority (EBA). This report will also provide an in-depth look into the structure of the database, as well as the principles followed to create the data model. It will also document the process of how the SDD is maintained and updated to meet changing needs. The report also includes the process undertaken by the BIRD team and supporting members on the banking community to introduce new reporting frameworks into the data model. During this period, the framework for the Financial Reporting (FinRep) standards was included, through a collaborative effort between banking representatives and the master and metadata team."

Taking the recent example of the 2008 subprime crisis, it is now clear it had its main drivers in excess credit supply and record household debt, which had been spiking since the 80  and 90  decades. 
Allied to weak risk management policies and the deregulation in financial markets, along with subprime credit concession and speculation regarding complex financial products, the households  debt levels rose to a point that helped generate one of the greatest financial crises in history, whose effects were felt around the globe. 
From the moment these crises happened, various authors studied and analyzed the reasons behind the events leading to them, and how they reached the magnitude to cause such an impact. Several studies concerning households  indebtedness and credit supply were made regarding many countries and provide a closer look at how these indicators are related and how they react in periods marked by financial crises as the ones described above. Some of them were able to prove that, indeed, there is a connection not only between them, but also with financial markets liberalization and weak risk management policies. 
After establishing a relationship between credit supply and household debt, and connecting both to business cycles, the core goal of this study is to evaluate the evolution of household debt in Portugal since the introduction of the Euro and which factors contributed with the most impact to that same evolution. 
Our work will start with a literature review to explain the credit-driven household demand channel concept and the dynamics implied and proceed with a statistical analysis of key indicators focusing on explaining the behavior of household debt in Portugal. These will include a time-adjusted correlations analysis and a linear regression model. Finally, we will present the conclusions reached through these methods, which resulted in a good performing model composed of five independent variables explaining the evolution of household debt to GDP in Portugal in different moments in time, and present future study possibilities to enhance the knowledge on this topic."

This thesis discusses issues relevant to the users of data obtained through sample 
surveys. 
In most of survey samples it is used generally complex sampling designs (which involve 
stratification, clustering, different probabilities of selection, different weights of units, 
adjustments to compensate the no responses, coverage errors, among other aspects), 
since the simple random sample proves impractical given the unavailability of frame 
that includes all units of the population under study. Moreover, the complex samples 
have the advantage of proving greater information for a given total fixed cost relative 
to the simple random sample. 
The data obtained through survey sample are used in statistical analysis involving 
calculations of population estimates for the parameters of interest, as well as in 
building models. For this, the statistical analysis comprises up a series of analysis tools. 
However, sometimes for different reasons, statistical analysis is carried out under 
conditions which do not reflect the complex situation of the research, considering the 
data as obtained by simple random samples. 
By ignoring the methodological aspects, the analysis can provide inaccurate estimates 
of the parameters, as well as their variances, and thus compromise severely the results 
of the research. 
To illustrate the research issue focused on this work it is used the Census of Agriculture 
and Livestock 2009/10 in Mozambique which was conducted by sampling for small and

Although the core concepts of CLV modelling have been studied for several years and the mathematics that underpins the concept is well understood, the application to specific industries is not trivial. The complexities associated with the development of a CLV programme as a business process are not insignificant causing a myriad of obstacles to its implementation. This research project builds a framework to develop and implement the CLV concept as maintainable business process with the focus on the Insurance Industry, in particular for the nonlife line of business. Key concepts, as churn modelling, portfolio stationary premiums, fiscal policies and balance sheet information must be integrated into the CLV framework. In addition, an automatic estimation machine (AEM) is developed to standardize CLV calculations. The concept of AEM is important, given that CLV information  must be fit for purpose  ù, when used in other business processes. The field work is carried out in a Portuguese Bancassurance Company which is part of an important Portuguese financial Group. Firstly this is done by investigating how to translate and apply the known CLV concepts into the insurance industry context. Secondly, a sensitivity study is done to establish the optimum parameters strategy. This is done by incorporating and comparing several Datamining concepts applied to churn prediction and customer base segmentation. Scenarios for balance sheet information usage and others actuarial concepts are analyzed to calibrate the Cash Flow component of the CLV framework. Thirdly, an Automatic Estimation Agent is defined for application to the current or the expanding firm portfolio, the advantages of using the SOA approach for deployment is also verified. Additionally a comparative impact study is done between two valuation views: the Premium/Cost driven versus the CLV driven. Finally a framework for a BPM is presented, not only for building the AEM but also for its maintenance according to an explicit performance threshold."

Nonsampling errors are alien to the sampling process, and may occur within the diverse stages of the survey process. The various nonsampling error types may be systemised as Specification errors, Frame errors, Nonresponse errors, Measurement errors and Processing Errors. 
Nonresponse errors have been one of the concerns of researchers, since they influence response rates, especially in human populations. Literature defends that, the higher urbanization is, the bigger is nonresponse. In Maputo city, where urbanization is increasingly higher, the findings of this dissertation indicate that response rate to surveys conducted by INE in 2003, 2004 and 2009 (respectively IDS, IFTRAB and IOF), is under 90% and dropping. Despite the methodological similarity in these surveys data collection, still the results of this study show that the response rate depends on the type of survey. Family households tend to cooperate with surveys related with labour force, more than the ones connected to health, expenses or people income. Detailed studies may ascertain the real causes to this households  behaviour. 
Identified nonresponse factors in this study that contribute to the reduction of the response rate in Maputo city, are the complete refuse, absence, respondents incapacity or ineptitude, absolute refuse during interview along with other factors related to unhappiness, and language barriers. Within these, the most important are complete refuse and absence of the whole household members during the interviews schedule."

Accordingly, the paper industry needs accurate data leading to annual inventories of 
eucalyptus forests. In addition to providing a clearer picture of current Portuguese

Nowadays, health professionals are faced with a large volume of information and indicators, whose timely interpretation requires knowledge and experience that are not always available in their institutional realities. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine began shortly after World War II. The scientific and technological development is presented more and more in a continuous and accelerated way and therefore, within several areas in information technology (IT) artificial intelligence have been increasingly highlighted. Artificial intelligence can be applied to various practical issues in our daily lives, a practical example in the medicine of the same, are the medical diagnostic programs. The area of medical sciences specifically addresses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease situations. One of the results of technology developments in medicine is the sustained growth of the amount of data available on the patient. A group of computer scientists and health professionals have dedicated themselves to a new area of research and systems creation specializing in medical artificial intelligence. There are databases with more than two thousand variables on patient, so that during a medical analysis it can be confronted with the challenge of analyzing and integrating hundreds of variables on a patient. The patient is surrounded by numerous monitoring and diagnostic equipment that contribute to the generation of more data. Monitoring a patient is one of the fundamental activities of a medical/hospital center that without artificial intelligence it would not be possible to control more than one patient in several critical situations at the same time. Simultaneously, problems in the doctor-patient relationship are discussed and the deficiency of clinical exams in medical attention, which makes clinical diagnosis more dependent on complementary exams, the importance of the computer in the medician and in the followup of a patient's health is increasingly emphasized. This is due to the fact that new technologies are increasingly being integrated, either by storing large volumes of patient data and variables. vii Artificial intelligence processes this data by means of algorithms, which tend to be increasingly improved by their own functioning and to propose increasingly accurate diagnoses. But if the technology provides the know-how, it will be up to the doctor to discuss the health problem according to the variables and indicators he has at his disposal and to present the possible solutions for the patient, indicating the know-how of the case. This whole process requires a continuous concern with the quality of medical information and a better development of the abilities to listen, examine and guide a patient and, consequently, to propose a correct and adequate diagnosis and treatment, following its evolution."

Usually, the description of a phenomenon requires a large number of variables, which affects the clustering algorithms efficiency. Many of these algorithms are sensitive to variables with large differences between their scales which gives them a bigger weight on the final clustering solution. 
HSOM (Hierarchical Self Organizing Maps) deals with this problem by grouping several variables in different subjects, producing a final segmentation where each subject has similar impact. 
This project focuses on this subject and has two main goals. Explaining SOM and HSOM methods by introducing them in a theoretical way is the first one. The second one is applying the HSOM and SOM methods in a customer bank database in order to build clusters by grouping the available variables in different subjects   Marketing, Performance, Risk and Socio-demographic. 
Thus will be possible to build an interactive and user friendly interface which will allow segmenting customers, making easier information search, supporting future analysis and creating different offers in direct marketing campaigns. 
In this context, HSOM (with seven clusters) and SOM (with five clusters) are achievable. The HSOM reduces the dimensionality of the problems, require less computational effort and construct a natural structure of the problem, using different SOMs for each hierarchical level."

The first three implementation steps aim at impact-based forecasting: (1) Understanding risk scenarios, (2) Identifying available hazard forecasts and (3) Identifying danger levels. Impact-based forecasting requires timely, complete, reliable and accurate data at a subnational level, which is however   especially in developing countries with a high data poverty   challenging. 510, The Netherlands Red Cross data team, has developed a Community Risk Assessment dashboard, that visualizes data on the INFORM risk index with three dimensions: Hazard & Exposure, Vulnerability and Lack of Coping Capacity. However, the number of available indicators decreases sharply when one goes from national down to district or even to the community level. The aim of this study was to downscale the vulnerability index to subnational level and to examine the relation between vulnerability and impact in Malawi. A literature review was conducted to understand the existing frameworks of vulnerability and the concept of impact. Thereafter, global and national open data sources were accessed to collate data of vulnerability and impact on subnational level. To determine the vulnerability level on subnational level, the gap in vulnerability data is characterized both vertically, in terms of data missing at lower administrative levels on indicators already used, as well as horizontally by adding new indicators. Thereafter, factor analysis was performed to reduce dimensionality of the dataset (in which there are a large number of uncorrelated variables) and to determine the vulnerability level. Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset makes it easier to visualize and understand the differences in vulnerability level across areas and to examine the relation with impact of floods. Five factors were identified and subsequently the five factors and the total vulnerability were successfully mapped to visualize the vulnerability level on Traditional Authority level in Malawi. The mapping revealed large differences between TAs and made it clear that data on a subnational level is essential in order to have a proper understanding of the reality on the ground. Finally, relations between these factors and impact data were examined. Impact data consisted of Internally Displaced Persons, Food Deficit and People Affected after being exposed to a flood. In conclusion, three relations were found between the vulnerability factors and impact which is a first essential step towards Impact-based Forecasting."

However, the majority of datasets are unstructured and contain textual data (Sulova & Nacheva, 2017). Therefore, in the last decade, different text mining techniques are developed to gain competitive advantage by extracting information from these datasets. However, text mining techniques in the educational context is still scarce (Nie & Sun, 2017). Therefore, this study applied text mining techniques on master dissertations to explore trends and patterns of these studies over the years. Dissertations that were published at NOVA IMS from March 2004 until May 2018 were collected from its repository. Thereafter, different techniques were applied to pre-process the data. More specific, unevaluable characters and stop-words were removed from the dataset and stemming was applied to reduce noise and the amount of unique words. Thereafter, two clustering techniques were applied. First, Topic modelling was executed with an LDA algorithm which suggested four topics. After inferring the topics, the following definitions were indicated: Geodata Information, Behavioural Studies, Information and Decision Systems, and Implementing Systems. Thereafter, clustering k-means was executed which resulted in three clusters. The clusters indicated Geodata Analysis, Online Behaviour, and Business Analysis. Furthermore, trends and patterns were analysed for each study area (i.e. Advanced Analytics, Statistics and Information Management, Information Management, Geospatial Technologies and Geographic Information Systems and Science). The results of this study create opportunities for NOVA IMS among others to reallocate resources based on these trends (Sullivan, 2001) and to allocate financial resources based on current patterns (Simoudis, 1996) and to encourage students to examine new interesting trends (Feldman et al., 1998)."

More specifically, we intend to understand how the overall student satisfaction is formed so that we can interfere in those formative indicators. We believe that it is possible to influence that satisfaction by improving the quality of the various items that form the learning environment of students, such as teaching, facilities, equipment, services and social climate of higher education institutions. 
To this end, we applied a questionnaire to the six academic units of UNL offering first cycles of studies (FCT, FCSH, Nova SBE, FD and ISEGI) or integrated master degrees (FCT and FCM), between 1st June and 15th July 2011. The completion of the questionnaire was done online, having been collected 1832 valid participations. 
Data was analysed by Structural Equation Modelling, using the PLS method (based on the variances matrix), combined with an exploratory factor analysis with extraction of latent variables through the method of principal components and Equamax factor rotation. This study resulted in a model with eight factors, six of which were formed by the indicators that we believe influence the overall satisfaction of students and two others that reflect the overall satisfaction and loyalty. 
We concluded that the factor that influences the overall satisfaction the most is the ""satisfaction with the personal experience and development"", followed by the ""satisfaction with the teaching quality"". Furthermore, we found that the indicators with the highest weight in these constructs are ""satisfaction with the sense of belonging"" and ""satisfaction with the teaching quality"", respectively."

To maximize efficiency and remain a viable alternative energy source, PV systems should ideally operate seamlessly without anomalies. In reality, however, several kinds of anomalies may occur that prevent PV systems from operating at their full capacity. Here, we address this problem by developing five algorithms for the detection of several PV-system anomalies, and establishing metrics to determine the severity of daytime shading and suboptimal orientation. Specifically, our algorithms are used to detect brief and sustained daytime zero-production, daytime and sunrise/sunset shading, low maximum production and suboptimal orientation. We apply these detection algorithms to several time-series of electricity production, which were obtained for two periods with contrasting weather conditions. When weather conditions were favorable, our algorithms successfully detected the majority of time-series labeled with either sustained or brief daytime zero-production, and either daytime or sunrise/sunset shading. Furthermore, these algorithms also produced a relatively low percentage of false positives, which indicates that most anomaly detections are correct. When weather conditions were adverse, the detection rate of our algorithms was similarly high, if not higher, than when weather conditions were favorable. However, the percentage of false positive anomaly detections is also substantially higher under adverse weather conditions, which indicates that the algorithms are generally more robust under favorable weather conditions. Our results suggest that, on the one hand, daytime shading is a relatively rare anomaly, although it may have a severe impact on PV-system efficiency that warrants its detection. On the other hand, suboptimal orientation appears to be relatively common, and our orientation index can therefore be useful to determine the severity of this prevalent type of anomaly."

Instead of promoting a short-term economic vision, it promotes a social vision that if measured can allow organizations to know if their actions are being conducted in a way that produces the greatest social impact possible. 
The present work aimed to create a methodological guide to measure social impact across nonprofit organizations among their specific communities and to understand if social impact is divided in social dimensions. A case study, analyzing the Rendimento Social de InserÁ?o (RSI) project of Campus Social of Santa Casa da MisericÛrdia da Amadora in partnership with a statistical company working in the social sector, was developed with the intent to create a model to measure social impact that could be comparable between nonprofit organizations. 
Focus groups and semistructured interviews were conducted in order to gather indicators. This was followed by a questionnaire and group interviews to collect data about the degree of change experienced by the beneficiaries of the project. Factor analysis and regression analysis were then performed to select the variables that have the most influence on social impact. A questionnaire and a model (formula) using these variables were then proposed to calculate social impact. 
Gathered data made it possible to notice that the social impact of the RSI project is not uniformly divided in the dimensions that were hypothesized   individual, family, society, and profession   and that they explain very little variance, making it better to produce models with all the variables simultaneously. None of the variables of the family dimension were significant and the remaining dimensions presented distinct contributions to social impact. 
The social impact of the RSI project of Santa Casa da MisericÛrdia da Amadora was fully measured and reported.

The internship was held in PT Portugal, one of the largest companies in the field of Telecommunications in Portugal, for a period of six months, between September 2013 and February 2014. In an era of high competition among telecommunications companies, the importance given by companies to their customers and, with it, the need to be in constant contact with them increases every day. Thus being, the development of a model based on behaviors and customer characteristics that interferes with their satisfaction, loyalty and, consequently, retention, which will allow a profound comprehension of which factors influence customer recommendation was proposed. Due to several reasons Portugal Telecom could not provide the necessary data to perform the study. In order to bypass this problem, a questionnaire was carried out and, subsequently, single equation models of customer satisfaction (explanatory methods) were applied. The sample collectes containes 193 answers as some were not viable since the respondents did not own a telecommunications service as well as critical questions were not answered. Although consciously the limitations resulting from the sample size, it was decided to proceed with these results due to the difficulty in raising respondents and since the collection time period available for this report was short. A characterization of the sample collected using descriptive techniques was also carried out, with the model that allows studying the impacts estimated using maximum likelihood regression, particularly logistic regression. From the literature review and knowledge acquired over the stage they were created two explanatory models for the recommendation. The results indicate that the complaint is positively influenced by household income, the price and the perception that individuals have on how PT cares about them and is negatively influenced by the claim, ie, as more complaints customers make, less likely it is to recommend the company."

Extending past literature on influencer marketing, this research aims to take a closer look into the impact of these two main categories of influencers   micro-influencers versus celebrities in the cosmetics industry, within the social network Instagram. We aim to explore when the use of each influencer type (celebrity vs. micro-influencer) is most beneficial according to the customers  perceived risk of cosmetic products. Two experimental studies are used to address this research goal. A first pilot study is conducted to evaluate the products of this industry with the most and less perceived risk by female consumers. After, a second pilot study and a main study are made to understand consumers  perceptions and attitudes towards these two types of influencers in dimensions as credibility, trust, expertise and influence ability on consumers  purchase intention and willingness to pay. The findings show under which conditions celebrities and micro-influencers are better for the brands regarding product perceived risk. Results suggest consumers are more willing to buy a high-risk product than a low-risk when promoted by a celebrity. Considering micro-influencers there is no significantly difference. While previous studies show the positive effects of micro-influencers on social media (e.g., Instagram) this research extends previous findings showing that product perceived risk is a boundary condition. In practical terms, this research contributes in helping marketers making more effective decisions regarding the choice of influencers in their marketing campaigns in social media."

For mitigation of credit and market risks there are number of testified models and quantitative techniques which gives us more or less accurate outcomes. However, for operational and strategic risks, available techniques and models have not remained that much effective. Here It is pertinent to mention that the strategic risk in banking industry may not be common to all because it is being viewed from other way round and named as  corporate governance  ù. 
The purpose of studies is to gauge the non-linear but direct relationship between corporate governance and operational risk management. It is important to understand that the operational risk is about set of operational processes and internal environment within the bank. Whereas the corporate governance is to regulate and maintain the business environment by implementing the policies and regulations. 
The role of corporate governance has remained a prime concern in banking industry especially from early 2000s. A part of top line and bottom line of business performance, the effectiveness of corporate governance can also be measured from 1) risk management, 2) audit and compliances and 3) regulatory requirements under the jurisdiction of local/applicable regulatory laws. 
It is important to understand here that the sensitivity of problem has been identified by the different scholars and regulatory authorities including European Central Bank (ECB), European Banking Authority (EBA), Bank of International Settlements (BIS), World Bank (WB) and Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) etc. These organizations have also been providing number of obligatory/voluntarily directives for ensuring results, but it is an on-going process in lieu of changing environment, technologies and other global issues."

The world markets liberalization and the unprecedented technological innovation has brought substantial increase in cross-border movements of goods and services, people and capital. In this context, the study of these flows becomes essential to better understand a highly interconnected world economy. In particular, the knowledge of FDI dynamics - financial flows - is imperative in the design and implementation of policies that promote it, since, according to economic literature, there is a correlation between FDI and economic growth. The search for new analytical approaches to direct investment statistics is equally relevant in an increasingly complex and innovative world. This dissertation emphasizes the relevance of direct investment given the role it plays as an engine of innovation transmission between economies, as well as its impact on economic growth, productivity and added-value through job creation and technology transfer. In this context, Banco de Portugal's direct investment database was analyzed, in order to contribute to the knowledge of existing information. The study also aims to explore new statistical approaches to capture the FDI dimension. For this purpose, it was decided to analyse the direct investment statistics allocated to the ultimate investing country (as opposed to immediate risk - information available to the public) in order to know the origin of the potential risk and the real strategic decision centre. This approach allowed us to identify situations in which the financial flow does not have a pure direct investment nature, being motivated by other accessory reasons (for example, tax optimization); known as capital in transit. The focus of the study is also based on the analysis of greenfield direct investments, a concept commonly associated with new investment and new business creation. Indeed, the use of prototype models for the calculation of greenfield statistics was used in order to measure the attractiveness of an economy in attracting FDI."

This study aims to understand the factors that influence the consumption of music through streaming platforms studying, particularly, the intention to purchase a paid version of a music streaming service and to recommend it. Therefore, an extension of the UTAUT2 model (version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, applied to the consumer side) was created. An online survey was used to collect data from 324 music streaming services users and the framework was tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). It also included in-depth semi-structured interviews in order to draw conclusions about the profile of the new music consumer. Our findings verify that habit, performance expectancy and price value play the most important role in influencing the intention to use a paid music streaming service. The intention to recommend these services was also confirmed. With this analysis, centred in UTAUT2 theory, we contribute with new insights about music streaming services consumer behaviour, providing several theoretical and practical implications to music streaming services providers."

Does this training have the desired impact on the educational experiences carried out by the teachers or is it insufficient to change significantly the school routines? Which are the factors that stimulate or delay a change in the school practices?

The answer to these questions is quite relevant at a time when a growing number of geography teachers are developing their training in GIS and these teachers seem to be very important for the geography teaching which is interested in renewing the processes of surveying and informed, effective intervention in the territory by the students, bearing in mind the challenges of a renewed territorial citizenship.

Teaching Geography using GIS has turned out to be a motivating experience and promoting apprenticeship. However, there are certain physical and human barriers which are difficult to surpass. Computing equipment in schools is not sufficient, the co-ordinators of the Resource Centres and the ones that are running the schools are not always receptive to innovation and the training in GIS by the Geography teachers has revealed itself insufficient."

analysis techniques and methods. Therefore new approaches are needed to transform
data into information, and ultimately, into knowledge. Exploratory data analysis is a
foundation stone in this process. It is concerned with the formation of a simplified
overview of data sets. Clustering and projection are among the examples of useful
methods to achieve this task. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm performs both, in
a non-linear mapping from a high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional space
aiming to preserve the topological relations in the data.
The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the effectiveness of SOM application in visual
exploration of physical geography data to support the delineation of Portuguese mainland
regions. The main justifications for the application of SOM in this issue are its features of
stressing local factors and topological ordering. For experimental assessment, the public
domain thematic maps from Instituto do Ambiente are used. Several authors  maps of
Portuguese regions are used for evaluation of empirical results.
Categorical attributes found in the data set are problematic in the SOM algorithm. One
way to tackle them is to convert them into binary attributes. For the task at hand,
Euclidean distance and unconstrained real-valued codebook patterns are shown
empirically as suitable approaches to deal with these binary attributes.
The distinctive character of geospatial data and the discrete nature of the SOM are
important issues that should be taken into consideration. In this respect, adequate
geospatial unfolding of SOM is presumed to assist a better representation of geographic
phenomena. Some approaches to assist this objective are put forward and experimented
such as weighting attributes and samples, and a SOM variant named Geo-SOM. Some
visualization methods to address the information extraction issue are also suggested.
Notwithstanding the vagueness of geographic phenomena, experimental results reveal
major patterns that are consistent with reference maps of Portuguese mainland regions. "

These errors are sometimes due to an uncertainty in the identification of the most adequate reference land cover classes by visual interpretation of aerial images and/or field work and/or due to an imperfect registration between the map and reference data. This uncertainty is caused by landscape fragmentation and/or presence of more than one land cover class in sampled areas, and also because difficulties in the identification of the threshold of coverage that is defined for each land cover class of the nomenclature. To accommodate the difficulty of identifying a single  true  or  reference  class and the positional uncertainty, the reference data protocol of an accuracy assessment may include identifying both a primary and alternate reference land-cover label along with a rating of the interpreter  confidence and also a location confidence rating that reflects the landscape characteristics in the reference classification obtained for each sample location. This additional reference information is used to construct two nominal variables (called CONF and LOC) in which the categories represent the  confidence  in the correctness of the map land-cover classification at a given location. Two accuracy measures that incorporate uncertainty in the reference classification are then derived by assigning partial credit weights to each CONF and LOC classes.

This work intends not only to demonstrate the potentialities of GIS in the education of children in primary school, but above all, to present a model of teachers' initial formation that allows exploiting of GIS, GIS in the Internet, WebGIS, as pedagogic tool.

This way, after presenting several examples of integration of GIS in the primary school curriculum, its integration in the teachers' formation is proposed. Teachers should be qualified, to handle this tool in technical disciplines, to make a good integration in the curriculum, as well as, to overcome eventual difficulties related with its introduction in the classroom."

We propose an approach to the Geography curricula centered on skills instead of themes. The aim is to have students develop skills that allow them to interpret and manipulate geographic information.

We believe spatial analysis in GIS environment is a helpful tool that promotes interdisciplinarity, one that can be used in non disciplinary classes (such as Tutored Study, Project or Civic Education). They help develop skills on analysis and managing information, relationships skills, technology skills and also logical and problem solving skills.

In this thesis we propose a methodology for the definition and taxonomy of spatial analysis concepts. Next, we propose a curriculum on spatial analysis, organized in ten modules that include, in all, the Geography curriculum for middle school in Portugal. At the end of the ten modules, all the mandatory skills (general and specific) that the students must develop throughout middle school, will have been developed.

Lastly, we suggest some future developments, namely the advantages of WebGIS, the publication of didactic materials as well as the practical application of this program in schools."

The location model was implemented with geographic information using

The solutions obtained with our data and with both clustering methods make

provided more robust and reproducible results than k-means, with the 
disadvantage of longer computing times. The main advantage of k-means,

This is however, not the common case. Like in all other fields of Science of Geographic Information, and of Cartography in general, there is an element that can have a smaller or bigger magnitude, but that is always present. That element is the uncertainty. The uncertainty exists once data is collected and propagates thru the process tree to the decision making associated. In Land Cover/Land Use cartographies, uncertainty can be associated both to thematic and structural issues, originating many times the propagation of error in a GIS Project. The best way to deal with this element is by knowing it. The present. dissertation consists on the study of methodologies that allow the production of a thematic uncertainty map in the characterization of Land cover/Land use. These methodologies are based mainly on the postulation that two distinct agreeing sources of information, assure a reinforcement of the confidence level, meaning less uncertainty. As a case study, 4 cartographies where selected for the Portuguese Continental Territory. Their different technical characteristics subjected these products to extensive harmonization procedures, crucial to make them comparable. From the produced uncertainty maps it was possible to determine the percentage of agreement for the compared cartographies, identify which areas have bigger problems in the Land Cover/Land use characterization, most conflicting thematic classes, amongst other useful information, both for the users and producers of this type of cartography."

The INSPIRE Directive, which came into force on the 15th May 2007, has created t e appropriate framework to Spatial Data Infrastructures development in Europe at different levels of government, focusing attention on geographical information needs for environmental policies evaluation, while maintaining an intersectoral vision and providing the gradual expansion to another sectors.

With this in mind, this thesis starts from the knowledge about Spatial Data Infrastructure development context and some examples carefully selected and presented to the completion of a proposal for a Local Spatial Data Infrastructure to Caminha Municipality, in Portugal."

The aim of this work is to develop a simple base of Geographic Information System with the objective of managing the Urban Municipal Cadastre.

In order to achieve this objective we proceeded with setting up and implementation module based on the studies of reality, followed by a breaking of the process into phases and into a model conceived on the basis of a complex system relating to physical space which determines the implementation of the same.

Here is a look ahead at the main completeness issues determined by phases, as fallow:

- Formulation of the problem, that consisted of identifying the phenomenon, the object of analysis and the formulation of theoretical conception.

- Analyzing the existing and available information. - Theorization that consisted of formulating representative of the theoretical phenomenon approaches of system conception in analysis.

-To choose the implementation model, that consisted of the structuring of the data and in the choice of the graphic part. - Definition of the circuit of the information that inside consisted of the organization and integration of all of the subsystems of an only System, SIG.
- Phase of the Implementation, that consisted of implementing the logical relationships already defined.
-Phase of Test, that consisted of testing the functionalities of the applications developed with the reality in study.

Thus, landuse plans become more flexible e closer to reality. The idea to use GIS the zoning of  Zona de IntervenÁ?o Florestal (ZIF) de Santo Ant?o (Santo Ant?o Forest Intervention Area) is due to the increasing number of forest fires and burnt area, the short cycle of the fire season, the abandonment of large areas, negligence of land owners, bad investment in local interventions and generally to a lack of policy measures for zoning and management in this area. In this project a comprehensive landuse is developed. Its main objective is to allow for multiple forest use taking in consideration a sustainable development of the area as well as the land owners interests. The Santo Ant?o Forest Management Plan started with collection of all the information concerning the srudy area. The next step consisted of building a detailed inventory for the study of the relevant variables for the study: climate, hydrology, geology, geomorphology, soils, landuse, fauna, flora, landscape, build environment, human communities including the characterization of the forest producer.

The Port Authorities have the need to manage diverse information like maritime infrastructure and land infrastructure, land sort, proprietary areas, commercial information, safety and environment inside the port area of their responsibility.

This necessity arises from the intention of the study and implementation of a Port Management System in the Port of Sines based on a Geographic Information System as a platform that can manage all this information and interconnection with existing systems operating in the port.

For this purpose the methods of developing information systems were followed. The applications of this techniques UNS - User Needs Study and CBA - Cost/Benefit Analysis, let emerge and confirm a few issues that should be taken into account in a real development.

During the first phase (2003) a software prototype was developed in collaboration with AlianÁa Florestal (Grupo Portucel-Soporcel). As this first version revealed poor flexibility and reliability, it was improved to better fulfil the operational and functional requirements. Therefore, within the scope of several European Framework Projects FP6 and FP7, the tool was given the necessary flexibility to suit other emergency scenarios. In 2008 Critical Software decided to create the commercial product PREMFIRE, expected to be purchased by entities devoted to fire combat. To help the company attain that objective, an academic internship was granted to the intern so that she would assume the functions of Product Management, in a broad sense. A set of tasks was thus defined, such as market and competence analysis, requirement specification from potential buyers, develop Marketing and divulgation material and prepare, execute and evaluate operational tests, among other activities."

Its advent has also pushed for the development of powerful proprietary and Open Source (OS) technologies to provide support for the implementation of GIS web-based applications. These applications may provide a standard platform for the management, visualization and analysis of spatial epidemiologic and entomologic data.

Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious, arthropod-borne viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that is transmitted by several Culicoides vector species. Portugal has implemented a BT Entomological Surveillance Program in May 2005 as a result of a partnership established between the National Veterinary Authorities and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Lisbon.

SIGLA WebGIS Portal was developed from scratch, exclusively using OS software, and aims to be an integrated solution for the management and sharing of entomological data across both organizations. Such an approach allows for near real-time data sharing under the form of maps, charts and tables and thus, generating new opportunities for BT surveillance and prevention."

GIS development and Remote Sensing have contributed a lot to the mineral resources management area. The GIS used in the mineral resources management as a resource for special approaches and models, permit characterization and even discovery of new mineral deposits and occurrences.

Method of weights of evidence was the one applied in the integration of GIS environment data, which proved to be very efficient. In this particular work, method of weights of evidence has made possible combination of evidence, such as geology, geochemistry, hydrothermal alteration zone, being based on the operations of space analysis, as well as in the ArcSDM environment.

The study resulted in creation of a map of iron mineral favourability for the region of Jamba, Angola, which highlights the benefit of utilization of GIS technology in this type of research.

The information about different correlations was used in this study, and the final product is provided by the map of iron mineral favourability.

Digital data acquisition and utilization is advantageous for the development of the mineral sector in Angola in general, and in Jamba in particular, and contributes to the correction of the eventual existent gaps.

understanding all location features, catchment area potential and consumers  behavior may reveal an
highly complex task.
This dissertation presents a decision support methodology to assess potential locations for the
new Hospital of Sintra (FHS), jointly with Hospital of Fernando da Fonseca (HFF), using Geographical
System Information methodology and location-allocation models.
22 distinct scenarios were modelled considering several location criterions   as availability of free
building space, proximity to security equipments (fireman and police forces), heliport, main road
network and public transport network, good solar exposition and low slope terrain   and the distribution
of Amadora and Sintra councils express and potential demand.From these scenarios result 10
optimum locations for new Hospital of Sintra construction. Of this set, solution E   located on Agualva
ward - was identified as the best location. This solution results from a scenario where the demand was
taken as the distribution of HFF patients in 2008, and the supply by the postcode area that had 4ha of
building terrain.
Choice for this solution is due to the improvement of less than 20 minutes accessibility, to 19,2%
for individual transport and 21,2% for public transport. This solution also benefits 7,5% residents that
currently are nearer other hospitals which aren t HFF, implying that in this way the 82,7% and 90,2% of
Amadora and Sintra councils population will have health care coverage.
In conclusion, the choice of the criterions used to identify the optimum location influences it and
not always the analysis of all the criterions reveals to be the best option. Is, without doubt, essential

In most of Portuguese census, the population data are associated to the parishes.
However, the population distribution tends to be spatially aggregated. So, to achieve
the disaggregation of population data we developed two methods: the areal

to find the values of population of each settlement.
The model proposed is a spatial data model that defines a cost surface of
accessibility to the rail network using as indicators the slope average, the distances to
train stations, to roads and rivers classification.
The methodology used in this work is developed in a context of

However, there is still a profound gap between theoretical models and their application in
practice of public participation. The known results of the use of PPGIS in Portugal - namely

A survey that assessed the utilisation of the Interactive Map of the Lisbon master Plan in the
context of public discussions identified usability issues and concluded that barriers remain
with regards to the cognition of geographic information. More specifically, the current design
of these systems requires a set of competences which lead to a discrepancy of citizen's access in function of their academic training or professional activity.
Improvement of the integration model in this process and the usability of its systems are key
factors promoting the effective realization of the potential of this instrument.

determine an optimal route for Ferrous pipeline.
The optimal pipeline generated was compared with the previously layout developed by
Ferrous, where it was possible to verify the efficiency of the tool for spatial analysis, and
provide better conditions for field work, since it rationalizes efforts, staff and costs.
In conclusion it was realized that a path of least cost or optimal path does not exist. Only
relative paths can be considered optimal under certain conditions. The parameters

At the same time should gradually proceed to harmonise geological mapping data in order to make them interoperable with those of the European Countries.

This dissertation argues that the process of harmonizing the data of geological mapping necessarily involves the modification/adaptation of the source data to the extended GE INSPIRE data model and indicates the reasons justifying it. The guidelines followed are in order to present a management structure more efficient for geological data mapping, interoperable and harmonised throughout the European Community.

Furnas Lake, located on S?o Miguel Island (Azores), has been presenting, over the last few years, obvious signs of eutrophication, resulting from entrainment of materials and fertilizers into the water body. In order to protect and enhance the watershed environment, as well as to restore the water quality of Furnas Lake, in 2005 was published the Furnas Lake Land Development and Watershed Plan (POBHLF).

In 2010, five years after the POBHLF approval, the regional government decided to evaluate and to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of that plan, resulting in the 1"" POBHLF's Assessment Report, whose findings point to the need of plan's alteration.

In this thesis, a methodological proposal for the alteration of the cartography of POBHLF, divided into two phases, is developed: the first, oriented for the alteration of the Constraints Map, based on the review and update of the easements and restrictions of public utility in force within the watershed of Furnas Lake, and; the second, directed to the change of the Synthesis Map, using the Land Change Modeler (LCM) module, available in IDRISI.

This group of technologies represent the capture of CO2 emissions at stationary sources, such as power plants and industrial facilities and their storage in geological reservoirs. The transport of CO2 would occur through dedicated pipelines connecting both regions. 
Usually, economic viability and CCS infrastructure optimization studies use as input multiple candidate pipeline routes between nodes of a hypothetical transport network, with the nodes representing places where CO2 is emitted and stored. In the end those pipeline routes are selected in a way that optimizes CO2 mitigation through time in a cost-efficient way. 
This study described a methodology that allows determining the most cost effective routes, and respective investment costs, between nodes in the West Mediterranean region through the usage of multi-criteria and least cost path analysis. A linear model was used to create a cost surface capable of identifying the investment costs, for each cell, accordingly to the local spatial characteristics. This surface, combined with the network nodes, was used to retrieve the best routes location, accordingly with the used parameters, to develop a CO2 pipeline and respective investment costs. 
The model results indicate that the proposed techniques allow achieving the objectives, but if needed the model can still be improved trough increase of spatial information quality, increase of the work resolution and/or refining the costing values."

The results obtained from this methodology were generalized to a cartographic minimum unit of 4ha, verifying that about 147ha suffered increase vegetation and about 85ha showed decreases. Most changes were detected in areas of Agricultural crops and pastures, and just one area of 7,5ha in Lagoa do Fogo showed decrease of vegetation on the Forest category (Eucalyptus globulus). This approach presented good results, verifying that 79% of the changes were correctly detected, while 21% showed error. The present study demonstrated that this methodology is an advantage for the detection of changes in the forest cover, so it is possible to center the update of Forest Inventory only in the change detected areas."

The intervention scenarios in the High case scenario show that policies effect over the ES produces 8% more than current policies and the Low case scenario produces 1%. The Business-as-Usual approach results indicate that the current policies performance over a future perspective may be responsible for the production of 5%. However, according the LULC trade-offs, current policies may reveal a loss of carbon sequestration and storage capacity over the territory, while in the intervention scenarios there is no loss evidence. 
This analysis allows us to conclude that the policies improvement may create conditions for a suitable LULC management, particularly in the carbon sequestration and storage, rather than the current framework of the policies."

Portuguese Environment Agency, to determine the areas where this pollutant
reaches higher concentrations. Spatial analysis was performed, first in an exploratory
phase of the data and represented in the ArcGIS geographic information system. In
this phase, spatial interpolations were carried out to conclude the exposure levels of
the population within the study area.
Ozone formation is a complex system (it is a secondary pollutant formed by
photochemical reaction from primary pollutants) with multiple agents interacting
with each other over time. An agent based model was coded to simulate this
phenomenon. The results allowed a more detailed study at a level of the statistical
block group, being a complement to the existing forecast maps for this type of
pollutant, currently available only at the regional scale."

GWR efforts lead to identify three variables that were statistically significant in explaining

industrial area with an adjusted R2 of 0,63 for Men and 0,59 for Women. A small set of 8 
municipalities with high correlation values was also identified (local R2 above 0,70). Stronger 
relationships were found in northwestern part of mainland Portugal. The local R2 tends to be 
higher when the emissions of PM10 are joined by the urbanization rate and the percentage

Within this context, several cities around the world have been launching different initiatives of bike promotion. Among these initiatives, bike-sharing systems are perhaps the best example given their universality. Bikesharing systems allow users to ride a bicycle between two places (not necessarily different places) without the need of having a bike of oneís own. These systems generate a big amount of data which can then be used to improve the systems themselves or to carry out research studies on different subjects related to mobility and the way how citizens move around and interact with the surrounding environment. In this paper, the open data automatically generated by the Brusselís bike-sharing system (Villo) is explored, aiming to elaborate a spatial regression model to estimate the number of bicycle trips at stations. The main goal of the modelling process is to understand the underlying factors influencing mobility patterns throughout the day. The weaknesses and strengths of the model approach are analyzed, especially in what regards its implementation in other geographic contexts and the possibilities of generalization for all bicycle trips. The first steps of the modelling process consist in setting up an exploratory Ordinary Least Squares model (OLS) in order to identify the potential explanatory variables among those available in the database. In the end, a GeographicallyWeighted Poisson Regression model (GWRP) is parametrized using the previous identified variables. The results suggest the relationships between the dependent and independent variables are complex and spatially varying. Furthermore, the results show hidden patterns that enable further local investigation on these relationships."

Among the linear models, OLS and GWR, the GWR model had a better performance.
However, the residuals presented spatial autocorrelation in both models, which
contradicts the assumption of independence of OLS, and indicates a poorly specified
GWR model. Poisson regression models were then implemented, as they are
appropriate to model count and rate data. The GWPR model had a better fit than the
global Poisson regression and also than the semiparametric GWPR models. The results
indicate that population, income, occupation, education and family environment are

The current land cover and land use mapping paradigm takes advantage of a variety of data options with proper spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions along with advances in technology. This enabled the creation of automated data processing workflows integrated with classification algorithms to accurately map large areas with multi-temporal data. In Portugal, the General Directorate for Territory (DGT) is developing an operational Land Cover Monitoring System (SMOS), which includes an annual land cover cartography product (COSsim) based on an automatic process using supervised classification of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. In this context, a range of experiments are being conducted to improve map accuracy and classification efficiency. This study provides a contribution to DGT's  work. A classification of the biogeographic region of Tr·s-os-Montes in the North of Portugal was performed for the agricultural year of 2018 using Random Forest and an intra-annual multi-temporal Sentinel-2 dataset, with stratification of the study area and a combination of manually and automatically extracted training samples, with the latter being based on existing reference datasets. This classification was compared to a benchmark classification, conducted without stratification and with training data collected automatically only. In addition, an assessment of the influence of training sample size in classification accuracy was conducted. The main focus of this study was to investigate whether the use of vi classification uncertainty to create an improved training dataset could increase classification accuracy. A process of extracting additional training samples from areas of high classification uncertainty was conducted, then a new classification was performed and the results were compared. Classification accuracy assessment for all proposed experiments was conducted using the overall accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The use of stratification and combination of training strategies resulted in a classification accuracy of 66.7%, in contrast to 60.2% in the case of the benchmark classification. Despite the difference being considered not statistically significant, visual inspection of both maps indicated that stratification and introduction of manual training contributed to map land cover more accurately in some areas. Regarding the influence of sample size in classification accuracy, the results indicated a small difference, considered not statistically significant, in accuracy even after a reduction of over 90% in the sample size. This supports the findings of other studies which suggested that Random Forest has low sensitivity to variations in training sample size. However, the results might have been influenced by the training strategy employed, which uses spectral subclasses, thus creating spectral diversity in the samples independently of their size. With respect to the use of classification uncertainty to improve training sample, a slight increase of approximately 1% was observed, which was considered not statistically significant. This result could have been affected by limitations in the process of collecting additional sampling units for some classes, which resulted in a lack of additional training for some classes (eg. agriculture) and an overall imbalanced training dataset. Additionally, some classes had their additional training sampling units collected from a limited number of polygons, which could limit the spectral diversity of new samples. Nevertheless, visual inspection of the map suggested that the new training contributed to reduce confusion between some classes, improving map agreement with ground truth. Further investigation can be conducted to explore more deeply the potential of classification uncertainty, especially focusing on addressing problems related to the collection of the additional samples."

In the first phase, the work consisted of collecting and analyzing national and internacional literature, where it was possible to obtain information on the subject of work, criteria and techniques to delimit a cycling network. The project report begins with a general framework on urban environmental problems, justifying the importance of cycling as efficient transport and less polluting, with positive impacts. Then analyzes the transport system, accessibility and mobility in Loures Municipality. It describes techniques or criteria that are key to the implementation of a bike path network. It is hoped that this project may promote soft mobility, in particular cycling in conjunction with other modes of transport in the municipality of Loures, contributing to environmental sustainability and enhancement of tourism (heritage)."

The root of my work as an intern was to ensure that all tasks related to the plugin implemented under the Marine-EO project were carried out successfully, always adding the code component and the graphical user interface. During this period, I investigated a lot about the Python language and how to conceive several functions for the other tools of the plugin through the combination of Python and QGIS software: PyQGIS. The tasks performed are intended to help the user to aggregate a set of information through a platform and GIS software, in the areas of interest, inside Europe. This report will demonstrate the architecture of the project, the various steps from the architecture to the QGIS viewing windows, considering the practice of Python code in an Integrated Development Environment. The results of the traineeship had a great impact on my ability to guide results and to be constantly encouraged to search for solutions to the proposed problems. I gained another perspective from GIS and curiosity to include more and more the programming part in my day-to-day life as a student and worker. In addition to this I can state that while doing the traineeship outside the comfort-zone   being in a country that is not mine and being a completely new area for me   it was very challenging task that ended up being overcome and profitable."

However, the irregular nature of most factions hinders the use of remote sensing, while winning the trust of the host populations to allow the collection of wide-ranging human intelligence is a slow process. Thus, our proposed solution, OR¡CULO, is an information system which detects spatiotemporal hot spots of conflict-related activity by analyzing the patterns of events extracted from online news sources, allowing immediate situational awareness. To do so, it combines a closed-domain supervised event extractor with emerging hot spots analysis of event space-time cubes. The prototype of OR¡CULO was tested on tweets scraped from the Twitter accounts of local and international news sources covering the Central African Republic Civil War, and its test results show that it achieved near state-of-theart event extraction performance, significant overlap with a reference event dataset, and strong correlation with the hot spots space-time cube generated from the reference event dataset, proving the viability of the proposed solution. Future work will focus on improving the event extraction performance and on testing OR¡CULO in cooperation with peacekeeping organizations."

This study evaluates the potential of thermal remote sensing for detection of thermal anomalies prior to Malatya-P¸t¸rge-Do?anyol (Turkey) earthquake using MODIS/Terra V5 LST/E (MOD11A1) data. In the previous studies, different methods based on different approaches have been suggested. In this particular study, four of the suggested methods were selected for evaluation as well as for comparison of different approaches. The analyses were carried out for fortnight before and after the earthquake. Depending on the method 4 to 7 years of daily daytime and nighttime MOD11A1 data were utilized. Furthermore, same set of analyses carried out for non-earthquake years as well as the earthquake year for the area. The results show that when only the earthquake year considered, all the methods used for the analyses detected the LST changes successfully and consistently not only before but also after the earthquake. However, thermal anomalies were not unique for the earthquake year and were also observed in the absence of seismic activity within defined time interval. Therefore, there exist no coherent evidence that indicates a direct link between the occurrence of seismic activity and the land surface temperature anomaly forMalatya-P¸t¸rge-Do?anyol earthquake. Based on the information extracted, it can be said that, the reason for observing LST changes even in the absence of the seismic activity is the effect of environmental factors which have considerable influence on the methods and thus the detection of LST anomalies. Therefore, it can be said that since the effect of the Sun  irradiation is minimal during night nighttime images would be more appropriate for thermal anomaly detection purpose. The findings support the argument that not every earthquake is preceded by detectable thermal precursor (Freund 2007; Saraf et al. 2009). On the other hand, not every LST anomaly is followed by an earthquake. Additionally, since the mechanism is not very well understood yet, it is not possible to identify earthquakes which would have thermal precursor prior to the incident. Therefore, it is concluded that utilizing LST anomalies based on satellite imagery for monitoring impending earthquake would not be adequate and feasible unless the mechanism of thermal precursors are very well understood."

For this, the CORINE (Co-Ordination of Information on the Environment) Land Cover (CLC) database was used to estimate the spatial distribution and quantity of carbon stored by each land cover class. Carbon stock was the result of each CORINE land cover class area multiplied by its respective carbon density. Densities were derived from literature, namely Portuguese Environmental Agency tables. Results show a decrease of carbon stock for the time lapse of both 1985-2000 and 2000-2006. The year 1985 had a total carbon stock of 173.08 Mt, 2000 resulted in a total of 170.22 Mt and finally the year 2006 with 159.97 Mt. Spatial distribution of the carbon stock was also verified as well as the statistics per class. Results show that the gathering of carbon stock records is a key step in monitoring changes in carbon sequestration. By using CORINE land cover as a default database, this methodology may be used by other countries members of the CORINE program and therefore may be easily comparable in between them. In another approach, the COS LULC (Carta de OcupaÁ?o do Solo or land Use Cartography) was used to compare the impact and effect of scale on carbon stock estimation, represented here by different minimum mapping units (MMU).

LULC change is one of the major influencing factors for landscape changes. There are many change detection techniques developed over decades, in practice, it is still difficult to develop a suitable change detection method especially in case of urban and urban fringe areas where several impacts of complex factors are found including rapid changes from rural land uses to residential, commercial, industrial and recreational uses. Although these changes can be monitored using several techniques of RS application, adopting a suitable technique to represent the changes accurately is a challenging task. There are a number of challenges in RS application for analysis of LULC change detection. This study applies objectoriented (OO) method for mapping LULC and performing change detection analysis using post-classification technique. This study consists of four major parts. The first part is implementing the OO method for mapping the LULC of the study area based on three consecutive satellite images: Landsat TM (1990), Landsat ETM+ (2000) and ASTER (2005). Principal component analysis (PCA) and image fusion are used to enhance the change assessment. Secondly, classification accuracy is another section of interest since the aim of this work is to accurately characterize the LULC changes. Due to unavailability of ground truth or reference data obtained at the time of image acquisition, the error matrix for accuracy is utilized supplied by the Definiens software based on training samples. An alternative method of accuracy assessment has also been adopted from the concept of the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2000 programme to justify the accuracy more robustly. The third part of this study focuses on LULC change detection analysis based on three classified LULC layers from (multi-temporal) images of 1990, 2000 and 2005. There are many methods of LULC change detection amongst which the post-classification comparison method has been implemented for this study. The fourth and final part is an additional chapter focusing on OO classification of very high resolution (aerial) image and its accuracy assessment based on a high quality existing reference layer. The study area is the M¸nster  Rieselfelder ù (sanctuary) and its surroundings which covers some fringe area of M¸nster city, Germany and covers an area of 100 km square. Even though the study area contains some part of the M¸nster city urban fringe area, it can be considered as rural area as a whole. The present study exhibits a great potential for accurate LULC change detection using object oriented image classification method using moderate to high resolution satellite images. It also shows us some technical steps that can influence the accuracy or enhance the change assessment. Although the preliminary results in this work seem to be promising, more study in this regard is required to improve classification results by utilizing OO method using very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery in future.

preferred method that may be used in Sundarban. A hybrid object-based classification
method was also developed to simplify the computationally demanding object-based
classification, and to provide a greater flexibility during the classification process in absence
of extensive ground validation data. The relation between NDVI (Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index) and canopy cover was tested in the study area to develop a method to
classify canopy cover type using NDVI value. The classification process was also designed
with three levels of thematic details to see how different thematic scales affect the analysis
results using data of different spatial resolutions. The results show that the classification
accuracy using QuickBird data stays higher than that of Landsat TM data. The difference of
classification accuracy between QuickBird and Landsat TM remains low when thematic
details are low, but becomes progressively pronounced when thematic details are higher.
However, at the highest level of thematic details, the classification was not possible to
conduct due to a lack of appropriate ground validation data. NDVI values were found to be
highly correlated to the canopy cover, and it was possible to classify canopy cover types
using NDVI. In absence of ground validation data, it was not possible to conclusively remark
on which method (pixel or object-based) is more feasible for vegetation classification in the
Sundarban forest. It was found that object-based methods are more suited for the VHR

The geo-spatial analysis of database generated from the satellite images, ancillary database and socio-economic information critical/vulnerable areas of land degradation are identified. Visual interpretation technique is carried out for land use/land cover by comparing satellite images of Landsat TM from 1988 to 1999 using GIS tools. Datasets of moderate spatial resolution (Landsat TM) have been processed. The geo-spatial analysis results show an increase in major land use/land cover such as agricultural land, dense mixed forest and settlement whereas there is decrease in barren land and open forest. The main land cover such as open forest and barren land are converted both into agricultural land and settlement. This change in land use indicates that the mountain land use is changing rapidly in the Himalayan region. It has not only disrupted ecological balance of the watershed but also reduced ground water recharge, increased run-off and soil erosion as well. Changing land uses/land covers have accelerated the process of soil erosion, loss of top soil and leaching of nutrients in upstream area on the one hand and sedimentation in lakes, reservoirs and river channels on the other. The rain-fed agriculture is contributing maximum to soil losses. High soil erosion is found in sloppy areas where unscientific farmland management practices are prevailing. Most of woody vegetated lands fall on low soil erosion areas. Information obtained using remote sensing techniques can help decision makers to prepare resource map accurately in less time and cost. For the estimation of soil loss by using Morgan approach, the various factor maps can be generated. The lower soil losses are recorded under forest cover and irrigated agricultural land."

variability. Being under influence of the Mediterranean climate the Iberian Peninsula is per se prone 
to droughts. In this study, we applied the Vegetation Condition Temperature Index for a 
spatiotemporal drought analysis in Iberia. As a compound remote sensing drought index VTCI 
incorporates information on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface 
Temperature (LST). Suchlike, it overcomes the disadvantage of NDVI, which faces a lagged vegetation 
response to droughts and makes it less suitable for real-time drought monitoring. We took 
advantage of the full range of the VTCI scale and thus describe soil moisture conditions from  very 
dry  to  wet . In order to study the effect of North Atlantic Oscillation on the establishment of 
droughts during spring and summer, we correlated VTCI with the NAO winter index of one year. The 
study was accomplished for the years 2001 until 2005; additionally we adjoined the years 2007 and 
2010 for their strong positive (negative) NAO winter index. The results as presented in the VTCI time 
series illustrate a typical  Mediterranean  pattern with humid springs and persistently dry summers 
inside the Mediterranean fraction of Iberia. At least two months in spring are regarded to be wet, 
though with a high temporal and spatial variability: One area can be wet in one year and dry in the 
next one. March often is drier than middle spring months exhibiting accumulated precipitation 
deficiency of winter months, whereas a weak start into the growing season can be determining for 
the crop harvest of one year. The summer months become persistently dry in the Mediterranean 
region, while the North and Northwest as well as high elevation areas generally obtain sufficient 
precipitation also during the warm season. Spring months are particularly important for vegetation 
growth in terms of water availability, though the spatial and temporal pattern changes considerably 
in the intra-annual perspective. We found a dipolar correlation between VTCI and NDVI particularly 
in April and June. In April the NW of Iberia shows a high negative correlation between NAO and VTCI, 
the SE a strong positive correlation. In June the pattern flips showing positive correlation in the NW 
and negative correlation in the SE. The other summer months exhibit a similar pattern as June 
though with less significant correlation, while the pattern during the spring months alters, which coincides with the climatic variability during this season. The correlation findings accord with 
observations from the VTCI time series: We gave the example of the Duero Basin in the NW, where 
in April (negative correlation) indeed NAO+ years were drier (due to decreased VTCI) than NAOyears 
(increased VTCI) and the SE exhibited the opposite behaviour. Similar findings can be 
evidenced for the NW and SE of Iberia in June and July and the Balearic Islands in March. In terms of 
land cover NAO influences geographical areas rather than certain land cover types, which can be 
explained by the widely human induced landscape pattern of Iberia. From the land use classes 
agricultural lands and low vegetation are the classes most vulnerable to droughts; forests are the 
most resilient land classes. 
The study of correlation between a certain NAO winter index and drought occurrences is particularly 
interesting for the development of an outlook system of soil moisture for the period of highest

oversee activities like fishing, marine transportation, navigation in general, illegal 
border encroachment, and search and rescue operations. In this thesis, we used images 
obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) over the Atlantic Ocean to identify 
what type of ship (if any) is present in a given location. Images generated from UAV 
cameras suffer from camera motion, scale variability, variability in the sea surface and 
sun glares. Extracting information from these images is challenging and is mostly done 
by human operators, but advances in computer vision technology and development of 
deep learning techniques in recent years have made it possible to do so automatically. 
We used four of the state-of-art pretrained deep learning network models, namely 
VGG16, Xception, ResNet and InceptionResNet trained on ImageNet dataset, modified 
their original structure using transfer learning based fine tuning techniques and then 
trained them on our dataset to create new models. We managed to achieve very high 
accuracy (99.6 to 99.9% correct classifications) when classifying the ships that appear 
on the images of our dataset. With such a high success rate (albeit at the cost of high 
computing power), we can proceed to implement these algorithms on maritime patrol 
UAVs, and thus improve Maritime Situational Awareness."

A case of study in notheastern Armenia,Dissertation,eng,http://hdl.handle.net/10362/14555,Geospatial Technologies,"The forest has a crucial ecological role and the continuous forest loss can cause colossal 
effects on the environment. As Armenia is one of the low forest covered countries in the 
world, this problem is more critical. Continuous forest disturbances mainly caused by illegal 
logging started from the early 1990s had a huge damage on the forest ecosystem by 
decreasing the forest productivity and making more areas vulnerable to erosion. Another 
aspect of the Armenian forest is the lack of continuous monitoring and absence of accurate 
estimation of the level of cuts in some years. 
In order to have insight about the forest and the disturbances in the long period of time we 
used Landsat TM/ETM + images. Google Earth Engine JavaScript API was used, which is an 
online tool enabling the access and analysis of a great amount of satellite imagery. 
To overcome the data availability problem caused by the gap in the Landsat series in 1988- 
1998, extensive cloud cover in the study area and the missing scan lines, we used pixel based 
compositing for the temporal window of leaf on vegetation (June-late September). 
Subsequently, pixel based linear regression analyses were performed. 
Vegetation indices derived from the 10 biannual composites for the years 1984-2014 were 
used for trend analysis. 
In order to derive the disturbances only in forests, forest cover layer was aggregated and the 
original composites were masked. It has been found, that around 23% of forests were 
disturbed during the study period."

The needs of obtaining reliable and updated information of parking slots availability are very important in the goal of traffic reduction. Also parking slot prediction is a new topic that has already started to be applied. San Francisco in America and Santander in Spain are examples of such projects carried out to obtain this kind of information.
The aim of this thesis is the study and evaluation of methodologies for parking slot prediction and the integration in a web application, where all kind of users will be able to know the current parking status and also future status according to parking model predictions. The source of the data is ancillary in this work but it needs to be understood anyway to understand the parking behaviour. Actually, there are many modelling techniques used for this purpose such as time series analysis, decision trees, neural networks and clustering. In this work, the author explains the best techniques at this work, analyzes the result and points out the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The model will learn the periodic and seasonal patterns of the parking status behaviour, and with this knowledge it can predict future status values given a date.
The data used comes from the Smart Park Ontinyent and it is about parking occupancy status together with timestamps and it is stored in a database. After data acquisition, data analysis and pre-processing was needed for model implementations.
The first test done was with the boosting ensemble classifier, employed over a set of decision trees, created with C5.0 algorithm from a set of training samples, to assign a prediction value to each object. In addition to the predictions, this work has got measurements error that indicates the reliability of the outcome predictions being correct. The second test was done using the function fitting seasonal exponential smoothing tbats model. Finally as the last test, it has been tried a model that is actually a combination of the previous two models, just to see the result of this combination. The results were quite good for all of them, having error averages of 6.2, 6.6 and 5.4 in vacancies predictions for the three models respectively. This means from a parking of 47 places a 10% average error in parking slot predictions. This result could be even better with longer data available.
In order to make this kind of information visible and reachable from everyone having a device with internet connection, a web application was made for this purpose. Beside the data displaying, this application also offers different functions to improve the task of searching for parking. The new functions, apart from parking prediction, were:
- Park distances from user location. It provides all the distances to user current location to the different parks in the city.
- Geocoding. The service for matching a literal description or an address to a concrete location.
- Geolocation. The service for positioning the user.
- Parking list panel. This is not a service neither a function, is just a better visualization and better handling of the information."

We operated tree iterations of systematic literature review (SLR) with totally 8667 identified publications (within 6 relevant databases and a search engine with priority of 4 most prominent and relevant journals and conferences in the field of mobile HCI and location based services), that 196 one of them included in first screening1, were thoroughly read in order to check with predefined inclusion criteria and overall, 56 papers (between those 196 papers) that qualified with our well-defined and updated inclusion criteria properties read in-depth at least two times to extract the data. In the first iteration 25 papers have reviewed and relevant data with considering our research questions has extracted and reflected in the first iteration table. In the second iteration, 24 papers which had adjusted inclusion criteria parameters have included to data extraction for filling the updated table. The last iteration according to the scarcity of publications in this realm and time limitation, has operated only with 7 literatures and relevant data extracted to fill in the last updated table. Results of the SLR showed the most frequently usability evaluation method was  Questionnaire  ù to achieve effectiveness and efficiency of the system, and the most frequently usability issue that detected within available literatures was  losing the spatial overview  ù which followed by  too much zooming and panning operations by users  ù that stems from the same problem; small screen size of mobile devices. We categorized the issues into two main groups of technological and spatial issues, which we only here focused on the usability issues relevant to map interfaces in mobile phones (spatial issues), not the technological problems relevant to the server or the hardware perspective (sensors, connectivity, battery drainage, GPS accuracy etc.). We have noticed the most frequently usability issue has happened in the mobile phone with average screen size of 3.83 inches, 87% of the cases in the laboratory environment, with users (not experts) with average age of 26 years old that 64.2% of them had relevant knowledge (GI2 knowledge). The low amount of field-based studies highlights the lack of considering real context in available case studies that in usability evaluation of location based mobile systems is highly important. Some traditional solutions have proposed to address the most frequently occurred usability problem in mobile map-based systems such as the techniques for visualizing the off-screen objects (such as Overview&Detail, Scaled Arrows, Wedge etc.) and some techniques for enhancing the zoom and pan operations (such as vario-scale maps, semi-automatic zooming (SAZ), tilt zooming, content zooming, anchored zoom etc.) that none of them were not completely suitable enough to be applied in these systems and the most famous systems such as Google Maps still working without taking advantage of such approaches, techniques and widgets, with a lot of usability issues."

and mitigation process. In that context, an assessment of landslide susceptibility 
becomes essential in an area that is prone to landslide due to its geographical 
condition. The Tawangmangu, Jenawi and Ngargoyoso Subdistric in Karanganyar 
Regency is the one of such areas, and is the area most frequently hit by landslides in 
the Central Java Province of Indonesia. 
In this study, three different methods were applied to examine landslide 
susceptibility in that area: heuristic, statistical logistic regression and Artificial 
Neural Network (ANN). Heuristic method is a knowledge-based approach whereas 
the latter two are categorized as data-driven methods due to the involvement of 
landslide inventory in their analysis. Eight site-specific available and commonly used 
landslide influencing factors (slope, aspect, topographical shape, curvature, 
lithology, land use, distance to road and distance to river) were preprocessed in a 
GIS environment and then analyzed using statistical and GIS tools to understand the 
relationship and significance of each to landslide occurrence, and to generate 
landslide susceptibility maps. ILWIS, Idrisi and ArcGIS software were used to 
prepare the dataset and visualize the model while PASW was employed to run 
prediction models (logistic regression for statistical method and multi-layer 
perceptron for ANN). The study employed degree of fit and Receiving Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) to assess the models performance. 
The region was mapped into five landslide susceptibility classes: very low, low, 
moderate, high and very high class. The results also showed that lithology, land use 
and topographical are the three most influential factors (i.e., significant in 
controlling the landslide to take place). According to degree of fit analysis applied to 
all models, ANN performed better than the other models when predicting landslide 
susceptibility of the study area. Meanwhile, according to ROC analysis applied to 
data-driven methods, ANN shows better performance (AUC 0,988) than statistical 
logistic regression (AUC 0,959)."

had increased by 17%, 72.49% and 79.75% whereas woodland (11.68%) grassland 
(7.73%) and shrubby grassland (86.14%) were reduced. Spatial metrics analysis 
showed that during 1987 to 2003 the Borena landscape went through important 
change. The resulting landscape has become more fragmented and indicated by the 
proliferation of large number of patch, increasing of patch density, decreasing of 
largest patch index; more diversity and heterogeneity with tend to more unevenly 
distribution of patch and irregular shape patch within landscape. In overall, the 
present tendency of bush and woodland cover in the landscape may lead to more

During the second half of the 20th century with socio economic development people abandoned unproductive land and overpopulated more fertile areas and cities. Landscapes started to be covered with natural vegetation or new plantation, often with highly flammable flora (conifers, olive trees, fruit trees, etc.) causing more frequent fire occurrences. Spain follows this trend with high incidence of fires in recent years, underling and emphasising the importance of understanding the causes and spatial distribution of these phenomena. In order to evaluate main characteristics of fires and the distribution of ignitions, 3292 fire events detected in Valencian Community during the period 2000   2006 are analyzed. GIS and spatial point process modelling approach are used to quantitatively study the fire effects in relation to variables such as cause, burnt area, proximity to urban areas and roads, population density, land cover and geographic elements. Point pattern analysis was performed using the library SPATSTAT with the statistical package R to determine the spatial intensity of fire ignition distribution and how covariates affect the pattern. Results showed that humans are the leading cause of fires in this region, but as well that the Valencian Community has significant number of lightning caused fires. Fire location are spatially clustered and high fire occurrences was found within areas 1   2 km from urban areas and roads, highly populated areas, in agricultural and shrubland cover, lower elevations and tender slopes. Results suggested that there is no simple fire regime for Valencian Community. The Akaike information criterion method is used to select the best inhomogeneous Poisson process model from a set, to best fit the data. The fitted model was diagnosed using simulation envelopes of K function and residual analysis. The model turned out to be inadequate because the fitted intensity function failed to capture the dependence of intensity on covariates. Regardless that a satisfactory model was not found, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding where fires occur and how they interact with socio-economic and environmental factors."

necessity for easy and convenient conversion between different models of geospatial data. Data
model transformation across heterogeneous systems can be hampered by differences in terminology

situation is an interface facilitating transformation of data to a desired format and immediate use of
the data, which are collected from different formats and models. Ontology-aware software with
shared understanding of concepts, enable users to interact with geospatial data models. Thus use of
ontologies could make a friendly environment to the user in translating the data conveniently.
Feature type ontologies, along with annotations are provided from an ongoing project at the Institute
for Geoinformatics (IfGI, University of M¸nster, Germany), in order to reconcile differences in
semantics. FME workbench provides a successful environment to execute set of rules for the data
model transformation using a mapping file, which can be developed externally. The thesis work
developed a user interface that includes operations to define rules for the translation of geospatial
data, from one model to another. Annotated feature types are taken as input, and the results are
encoded as FME Mapping files. The overall methodology involves three phases. Namely:
development of the interface, test execution with sample data, usability test. In the development
phase, the interface is designed with requirements identified in the literature survey. In the second
phase the interface is verified for its proper functionality by executing the transformation on the trial
data-set using two sample ontologies. The user-friendliness of the interface was evaluated by
conducting a usability test. The GUI is named as Ontology Based Schema Mapper (OBSM), consisting
four main components; Mapping Component, Ontology Repository, Rules Repository and Rule
Generator. The functionality of the OBSM could be expressed as follows. The initial stage of the
procedure imports the annotated feature types of the source data model to the system, while saving
a copy in the Ontology Repository. Then two alternative options are given to the user; either to
define new rules of transformation or to retrieve existing set of rules for transformation. If the user
selects to define new rules, the target annotated feature type is also imported to the system. The user
can generate OBSM mapper file, for the set of defined rules using the Rule Generator and save a copy
in the Rules Repository or export to a desired location. The interface was tested with feature types
used within the INSPIRE context. In the trial execution of the transformation, the source feature types
are from the ATKIS data model and the translation rules are defined to translate into the INSPIRE data
model for transport networks. The tool was evaluated for its usability, following principles for a
heuristic evaluation. The evaluation was performed using a questionnaire and a prototype of the tool
within a group of experts. Results proved that the users identify the tool as a convenient and easy to

(Forbus, K., Usher, J., & Chapman, V. 2004). Compared with verbal or textual language, sketch map is a
more interactive mode that more directly supports human spatial thinking and thus is a more natural way to
reflect how people perceive properties of spatial objects and their spatial relations. One challenging
application of sketch maps is called Spatial-Query-by-Sketch proposed by Egenhofer. Being a design of
query language for geographic information systems (GISs), it allows a user to formulate a spatial query by
drawing the desired spatial configuration with a pen on a touch-sensitive computer screen and get it
translated into a symbolic representation to be processed against a geographic database (Egenhofer, M.
1997).
During the period of sketch map drawing, errors due to human spatial cognition in mind may occur. A ready
example is as follows: distance judgments for route are judged longer when the route has many turns or
landmarks or intersections (Tversky, B. 2002). Direction get straightened up in memory. When Parisians
were asked to sketch maps of their city, the Seine was drawn as a curve, but straighter than it actually is
(Milgram, S. and Jodelet, D. 1976). Similarly, buildings and streets with different shapes are often simply
depicted as schematic figures like blobs and lines. These errors are neither random nor due solely to
ignorance; rather they appear to be a consequence of ordinary perceptual and cognitive processes (Tversky,
2003). Therefore, when processing sketch map analysis and representing it in a formal way, like Egenhofer's
analysis approach for Spatial-Query-by-Sketch, the resulting formalization must necessarily be wrong if it
does not account for the fact that some spatial information is distorted or omitted by humans. Therefore,
when sketch map analysis is processed and represented in a formal way same as Egenhofer  analytical
approach to Spatial-Query-by-Sketch, the resulting formalization is simply erroneous since it never takes
into account the fact that some spatial information is distorted or neglected in human perceptions. Though
Spatial-Query-by-Sketch overcomes the limitations of conventional spatial query language by taking into
consideration those alternative interaction methods between users and data, it is still not always true that
accuracy of its query results is reliable. This thesis investigates the above issue by exploring the impact of human schematization and systematic
errors on Egenhofer's approach for sketch map analysis. 10 experiment participants are asked to draw maps
of two small areas with approximate space of 0.21 km2. They are all familiar with the areas and able to finish
their tasks with their inner eyes. The experiment gives the clue to how to modify Egenhofer's approach for
sketch map analysis, that is, it will tell us which are cognitively important criteria of the sketch map and
which are of less importance. There are two main steps in the experiment analysis: (1) to compare with the
map of the reality and abstract inaccuracy or errors people made to find significant influential factors; and (2)
to analyze these factors individually to see how they work in the framework of Egenhofer's approach to
sketch analysis. As a wrap-up, modifications are suggested to improve so as to enhance Egenhofer's
approach to sketch map analysis, especially its cardinal directions."

and water bodies into reclaimed builtup lands etc. This new urban fabric should be 
analyzed to understand the changes that have led to its creation. 
The primary objective of this research is to predict and analyze the future urban growth of 
Dhaka City. Another objective is to quantify and investigate the characteristics of urban 
land cover changes (1989-2009) using the Landsat satellite images of 1989, 1999 and 
2009. Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) and its surrounding impact areas have been 
selected as the study area. A fisher supervised classification method has been applied to 
prepare the base maps with five land cover classes. To observe the change detection, 
different spatial metrics have been used for quantitative analysis. Moreover, some postclassification 
change detection techniques have also been implemented. Then it is found 
that the  builtup area  land cover type is increasing in high rate over the years. The major 
contributors to this change are  fallow land  and  water body  land cover types. 
In the next stage, three different models have been implemented to simulate the land 
cover map of Dhaka city of 2009. These are named as  Stochastic Markov (St_Markov)  
Model,  Cellular Automata Markov (CA_Markov)  Model and  Multi Layer Perceptron 
Markov (MLP_Markov)  Model. Then the best-fitted model has been selected based on 
various Kappa statistics values and also by implementing other model validation 
techniques. This is how the  Multi Layer Perceptron Markov (MLP_Markov)  Model has 
been qualified as the most suitable model for this research. Later, using the MLP_Markov 
model, the land cover map of 2019 has been predicted. The MLP_Markov model shows 
that 58% of the total study area will be converted into builtup area cover type in 2019. 
The interpretation of depicting the future scenario in quantitative accounts, as 
demonstrated in this research, will be of great value to the urban planners and decision 
makers, for the future planning of modern Dhaka City."

Gojam, Ethiopia. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is widely
accepted as a good indicator for providing vegetation properties and associated changes

persistent particularly in the small rainy season Belg and continues to affect vegetation
condition and thus Belg crop production. Statistical correlation analyses shows strong
positive correlation between NDVI and rainfall in most years, and negative relationship
between temperature and NDVI in both seasons. Although El Ni?o and La Ni?a events
vary in magnitude in time, ENSO analyses shows that two strong La Ni?a years and one
strong El Ni?o years. ENSO analyses result shows that its impact to the region rainfall
variability is mostly noticeable but it is inconsistent and difficult to predict all the time.
The NDVI anomaly patterns approximately agree with the main documented
precipitation and temperature anomaly patterns associated with ENSO, but also show
additional patterns not related to ENSO. The spatial and temporal analyses of climate

The aim of this research is to develop a database and ontological framework that incorporates Spatial and Thematic verification to support the describes cadastre update and facilitate the automation of the process within municipal entities. The development of an object relational database management system is supported by an Entity-Relation model compliant with INSPIRE data specification on theme Cadastral Parcels and ISO/LADM models. The Methontology method is applied to model a decree-law ontology that enables the representation of legal relationships between the municipal master plan and the urban land use categories. The Spatial comparison operation uses a spatial predicates set based on the Calculus Based Method to test and classify relationships between the rustic and urban geometries. The Thematic comparison performs a set of operations to ascertain the relationship between rustic and urban categories, extract and assign its annotation to the urban project. Finally, a free and open-source Java Plugin integrates the ORDBMS and the ontology models and implements the proposed methods. iv The Plugin provides an efficient platform for the executation of data visualisation and comparison, although it is limited to the information retrieved from the analysis of the Spatial and Thematic relationships. An assessment on distinct design principles demonstrate that the integration of the selected information technologies can ensure the adaptation of the Plugin to the various cadastre update processes existing in the Municipality. The proposed cadastral database model can facilitate the integration of the municipal cadastre update process in the future SiNErGIC platform. The use of free and open-source GIS and Semantic Web technologies can efficiently support less sophisticated cadastral operations and assist the customisation and adaptation within the municipal entities.

Employment containment is a measure of the proportion of people that work in a 
location close to their home. Recent urban planning policies in Melbourne have aimed 
to improve employment containment in the city  suburbs. While there has been 
analysis of the rates at which people both live and work within broadly defined  local 
areas , little work has been done to investigate employment containment using smaller 
and more uniform catchment areas as the unit of analysis. This research attempts such a 
finer scale analysis using dasymetric downscaling techniques. A regression modelling 
approach supported by land use data, alongside a binary dasymetric method, is used to 
develop fine scale estimates of employment distribution, while binary and populationdensity 
weighted methods are used to develop a fine scale estimate of working 
population distribution. For the employment distribution estimate, the Poisson model 
that distributed employment to employment-related land use classes produced the 
smallest error. However, the error produced by this model is still high. For the working 
population distribution estimate, the population-density weighted estimate is the more 
accurate of the approaches, and overall produced low error. For the employment 
containment analysis, a number of employment centres were randomly selected and an 
employment containment catchment has been derived from a 5 km2 commuting 
distance catchment. Commuting flows from an origin-destination matrix were areaweighted 
to estimate flows into the employment centre from the 5 km2 catchment. The 
method is found to be potentially useful; however inspecting the results of this 
employment containment calculation highlighted flaws in the current estimates that 
should be addressed before the measures can be used to further analyse employment 
containment in Melbourne. Improvements to this method would support urban strategic 
and transport planning analyses at a metropolitan-wide scale."

Unsystematic Root Mean Square Errors, Index of Agreement, Coefficient of

performs better for both indices, when the sample density is too low, but the 
performance is questioned by the inclusion of measurement errors in the interpolated surfaces. All the error measurements show a decreasing trend with the 
increasing sample density, and the index of agreement and confidence of prediction 
show an increasing trend over years. Finally, the strong correlation between the 
Sample Coefficient of Variation and the performance measurements, implies that 
the more representative the samples are of the climate phenomenon, the more 
improved are the performances of the spatial interpolation techniques. The 
correlation between the sample coefficient of variation and the number of samples 
implies that the high representativity of the sample is attainable with an increased

Numbers of users, versions and confirmations were counted or calculated and involved as positive indicators, while numbers of various corrections were treated as indicators having a negative influence on the development of trust in information. 
Analysis of the dataset and thinking about how to incorporate what in the trust measure showed for example how ideas about time decay could be different.

It allowed for generating lists of tags to be described when publishing information about particular features. This was of importance for assessing information completeness in measuring the quality of the data. 
The results of the trust measure have been compared to those if the quality measure and an evaluation of this comparison shows significant signs of support for the hypothesis that VGI data quality can be estimated based on a trust model that incorporates data provenance. On the other hand there is also a significant number of features of which both measures show opposite indications of quality. 
Various single assumptions, simplifications and the relatively small size of the dataset restricted the possibilities for obtaining more accurate results. Confirmation or denial of the ideas that resulted from this research can be made by enlarging the dataset and experimenting with different methods. Automating all the data processing would be necessary."

very probable that a pattern may have different definition and mining methodology for researchers from different background, such as Geographic Information Science, Data Mining, Database, and Computational Geometry. How to systematically define these

paper is trying to tackle with this challenge by three steps. First, the input trajectory data is classified; second, taxonomy of spatio-temporal patterns is developed from data mining point of view; lastly, the spatio-temporal patterns appeared on the previous publications are discussed and put into the theoretical framework. In this way, researchers can easily find needed methodology to mining specific pattern in this framework; also the algorithms needing to be developed can be identified for further research. Under the guidance of this framework, an application to a real data set from Starkey Project is performed. Two questions are answers by applying data mining 
algorithms. First is where the elks would like to stay in the whole range, and the second 
is whether there are corridors among these regions of interest."

publishes more than 40 drafts or final standards, which provide basic rules for the

2007 is also a major milestone in the development of SDI. While, the coverage of the SDI providers is still very limited due to the national or natural boundaries which make the SDI can not be largely used in some professional areas. Therefore, a legally-protected business environment is necessary. 
To pursue an effective and innovative operational model, the roaming concept of GSM 
was mitigated to SDI named Roaming Enabled SDI(r-SDI) (Roland M. Wagner, 2006). 
In order to make this innovative idea into reality, the first and must step was to find 
specific issue   Geospatial information licensing which was also an urgent problem to the normal SDI as well as rSDI. 
In this paper, firstly, a Creative Commons licensing approach was adapt in the Catalogue 
Service (CSW) which enabled the clients to get the advanced query results according to 
the license types. The rights management was successfully enhanced. Secondly, a 
suitable structure for the operation model in rSDI was conducted, moreover, 5 business 
use cases were proposed to CSW in different specifications sets. The contractship 
concepts were applied to the metadata level. Finally a demonstration designed on 
 deegree  ù   a free SDI software and web service theory was conducted, by which users 
can query metadata documents by title, product type, service type, license type, even in a roaming environment. Meanwhile, with the comparison between OGC and INSPIRE

deforestation, this research has analyzed the trend of forest cover in the study area by 
combining NDVI differencing and image classification to describe the forest cover 
change. In order to do that, Landsat images acquired in different time (1996, 2000,

doing normalization of one image to another image initially. Subsequently, thresholds 
to identify the change and no change have been carried out separately for decrease 
and increase part. Apart from that, image classification was applied using supervised 
classification. Eventually, land cover change detection has been performed by 
combining NDVI differencing and image classification. It has been proved by the 
research that forest in study area has decreased by 6% during 1996-2005. 
In order to forecast future forest cover, three models were chosen to get the 
best model for prediction. These models are Stochastic Markov Modal, Cellular 
Automata Markov (CA_Markov) Model, and GEOMOD. To measure the best model 
among them, Kappa index was employed to validate the simulation. As the result, 
GEOMOD performed the highest Kappa. Therefore, GEOMOD was implemented to

geoprocesses on the Cloud platform Amazon Web Service (AWS), through OGC 
Web Processing Services (WPS) using the 52North WPS framework. This evaluation 
is performed using a new implementation of a Geostatistical library in Java with

of micro instances on the Cloud through GridGain technology. The Geostatistical library obtains similar interpolated values compared with the 
software ArcGIS. In the Inverse Distance Weight (IDW) and Radial Basis Functions 
(RBF) methods were not found differences. In the Ordinary and Universal Kriging 
methods differences have been found of 0.01% regarding the Root Mean Square 
(RMS) error.The parallelization process demonstrates that the duration of the interpolation 
decreases when the number of nodes increases. The duration behavior depends on the 
size of input dataset and the number of pixels to be interpolated. The maximum 
reduction in time was found with the largest configuration used in the research 
(1.000.000 of pixels and a dataset of 10.000 points). The execution time decreased in 
83% working with 10 nodes in the Ordinary Kriging and IDW methods. However, 
the differences in duration working with 5 nodes and 10 nodes were not statistically 
significant. The reductions with 5 nodes were 72% and 71% in the Ordinary Kriging 
and IDW methods respectively. Finally, the experiments show that the geoprocessing on Cloud Computing is feasible 
using the WPS interface. The performance of the geostatistical methods deployed 
through the WPS services can improve by the parallelization technique. This thesis 
proves that the parallelization on the Cloud is viable using a Grid configuration. The

overcome is that humans always simplify the environments they have experienced and this 
is reflected in the sketches they draw. One such simplification is manifested as aggregation 
or combination of spatial objects into conceptually or spatially related groups. 
In this thesis I develop a system that uses reasoning tools of the RCC-8 to evaluate sketchbased 
queries and provide a method for minimizing the effects of aggregation by 
determining whether a solution to a query can be expanded if some groups of regions are 
assumed to be parts of a larger aggregate region. If such a group of regions is found, then 
this group must be included in the solution. The solution is approximate because the 
approach taken only verifies that assumed parts of an aggregate are not inconsistent with 
the configuration of the whole solution. Only cases where the size of the solution equals the 
size of the query minus one are analysed. 
It is observed that correctly identifying aggregated regions leads to solutions that are more 
similar to the original query sketch when the size of every other solution is smaller than the 
size of the query or when a lower limit is placed on the acceptable size of a solution because 
the new, expanded or refined solution becomes more complete with respect to the sketch

This thesis explores how Area-to-Area and Area-to-Point kriging can be applied to

Results are compared to the traditional methods used to analyse areal data. 
Additionally, the study investigates burglary hotspots and the relationship between

The study concludes that Area-to-Area and Area-to-Point Poisson kriging methods 
may improve on existing approaches to interpolating areal crime data. The 
visualisation of areal data is improved through the smoothing of rates based on small 
denominators, and visual bias may be decreased by using Area-to-Point kriging. 
Using the kriging estimates of these techniques as inputs into hotspot and regression

Besides, lack of appropriate monitoring techniques aggravate the situation of drought in the study area. In a region where the numbers of meteorological stations are not sufficient enough to monitor the onset and extent of drought, remotely sensed data presents fast and economical way of information as the ground condition reflects the overall condition of rainfall and soil moisture. In this study, the drought monitoring approach is developed using Terra-MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Land surface Temperature (LST) level-3 products. The approach integrates the land surface reflectance and thermal properties as well as the NDVI changes to identify the extent and pattern of the past drought years. From the NDVI versus LST scatter plot, we extract Vegetation Temperature condition index (VTCI) to map the variability and trend of the drought years. The year 2003 was found to be the driest year (more than 90% of the region affected by drought) and the season that showed increasing intensity of drought being Dihra. The correlation (r > 0.7) between rainfall and VTCI across the major meteorological stations suggested that the index could be used as good indicator of drought as rainfall does. The overall trend of drought condition for selected drought years suggested that eastern and southern regions will experience more severe drought in the coming year. Moreover, VTCI value for October from 2000-2011 showed similar increase intensity of drought condition. In addition, it was observed that sparse vegetation and shrub land are highly variable and bare soil region is consistently dry.

The main objective of the study was to verify the pattern of nest site distribution in the sanctuary, the influence of environmental covariates and possible interaction between nest sites and between nest sites of two gorilla groups   the Major and Minor groups. Spatial point pattern analysis methods were implemented in the R software environment for this purpose. Overall, we sought to fit models that could best estimate an intensity function for nest site distribution in the sanctuary. Resulting models revealed that nest site distribution does not conform to a Poisson process, and that the data can be better described by a combination of environmental factors and interaction between nest sites. Univariate models fitted to different nest site categories proved to be more useful than bivariate models in defining intensity functions for nest site distribution. The final model category chosen for the data therefore constituted a combination of the effect of covariates and higher-order interaction between nest sites. This set of models, chosen through their AIC values, showed that nest site distribution in the sanctuary exhibits characteristics of attraction so that clustered patterns are observed. Gorillas tend to create hotspots for nest site location, with southern parts of the sanctuary proving to be very much avoided. Intensity tends to increase with increasing distance to the centre of the sanctuary. Coefficients obtained from the models also showed that gorillas prefer constructing nests close to transition vegetation, on steep slopes and generally on east-facing slopes. In the dry season however, colonizing forests exert a greater attraction on nest sites, which can be attributed to the fact that transition zones experience such edge effects as bushfires, and plants that provide food (such as Zingiberaceae) do not bear fruit in this season. These can be assumed to be specific habitat requirements of this subspecies of gorillas. Also, intensity drops with increasing elevation. Interaction parameters obtained from the bivariate models also suggested that there is attraction between nest sites of the Major (sites with more than 6 nests) and the Minor groups. This analysis is the first of its kind for this subspecies, and we recommend that further models can be fitted to include a wider range of covariates (both anthropogenic and natural) as they may be available to expand the scope of the models."

We analyze three kinds of scenarios for translation encoding and decide Provider-Translation as our best practice for Translation Encoding implementation. To interpret translation contents into computer, we present an encoding language: Translation Expression and a corresponding software system design.

Farmland supports more bird species of conservation concern than any other habitat in Europe. Therefore, it is imperative to understand farmland species ü relationship with their habitats. Bird conservation requires spatial information; this understanding not only serves as a check on the individual species ü populations, but also as a measure of the overall health of the ecosystem as birds are good indicators of the state of the environment. The target species in this study is the corn bunting Miliaria calandra, a bird whose numbers in northern and central Europe have declined sharply since the mid-1970s. This study utilizes public domain data, namely Landsat imagery and CORINE land cover, along with the corn bunting üs presence-absence data, to create a predictive distribution map of the species based on habitat preference. Each public domain dataset was preprocessed to extract predictor variables. Predictive models were built in R using logistic regression. Three models resulted from the regression analysis; one containing the satellite-only variables, one containing the land cover variables and a combined model containing both satellite and land cover variables. The final model was the combined model because it exhibited the highest predictive accuracy (AUC=0.846) and the least unexplained variation (RD=276.11). The results have shown that the corn bunting is strongly influenced by land surface temperature and the modified soil adjusted vegetation index. Results have also shown that the species strongly prefers non-irrigated arable land and areas containing vegetation that has high moisture content while avoiding areas with steep slopes and areas near human activity. This study has shown that the combination of public data from different sources is a viable method in producing models that reflect species ü habitat preference. The development of maps that are comprised of information from both satellites and land cover datasets are of importance for species whose habitat requirements are poorly known."

among the strategies currently adovated for SDI development by various SDI experts. This 
research therefore analyzes SDI development with reference to the institutional arrangements,

South Africa from the developing countries. 
A questionnaire survey and literature review was carried out on relevant GI organizations to 
ascertain the status of the NGDI development and the potentials of PPP in the geospatial 
sector in Nigeria. The analysis reveals that PPP has a high level of acceptance among 
respondents as an approach in the future for the development of SDI in Nigeria. However, 
absence of SDI policy directive, coordination of donor funded projects in the sector are 
identified as major hurdles that has to be overcome for the success of SDI development 
through PPP in Nigeria. Moreover, comparative analysis of the selected cases shows some 
unique similarities and differences between developed and developing countries. Thus, it is 
acknowledged that public and private sectors, by nature are complementary and hence 
effective PPP can only be created through  mutually designed, analyzed and accepted 
instruments of cooperation and collaboration  ù. 
In conclusion, for SDI development to be achieved successfully through PPP approach 
deliberate and sincere effort need to be made by the government to create enabling 
environment for the private sector participations in the sector. This, therefore, involves among 
others the passing of the long awaited GI policy in the country, creating better environment 
for dialogue between the government and the private sectors, promotion of talk shows and

determine the nature, extent and rate of changes and to analyze the spatio-temporal land
use/land cover change patterns and fragmentation that has occurred in Valencia Municipality.
Multi-temporal Landsat MSS1976, TM1992 and ETM2001 images were acquired. Digital

More than 130 training samples were selected for classification of the Landsat images using
supervised method parallelepiped-maximum likelihood algorithm in ERDAS Imagine 9.1,

Distinct changes have occurred on the land use/land cover. Built up areas increased from
3415ha (24%) to 4699ha (34%) while agricultural areas decreased from 6560ha (48%) to
5493ha (40%) from 1976-2001. Built up class showed an overall amount and extent of change
of 1284ha (39%) while agricultural areas decreased 1067ha (16%) from 1976-2001. The rate
of change was as high as 1.8 % for built up surface while agricultural lands were converted at
1% per year. Similarly, the spatial metric calculation e.g., number of patch, largest patch
index and patch fractal dimension values revealed a continued growth in the built up surface.
Rapid urban growth was contiguous to the historical urban core with less fragmentation. Built
up surface expansion followed certain pattern depending on the increasing development
pressures, population and highways. Conversely, spatial metrics value for the non-built up
classes decreased substantially over time showing prevalence of landscape fragmentations.
The change analysis integrated with spatial metrics performed in this research allowed for the
monitoring of land use/land cover changes overtime and space. Mapping of the spatiotemporal land use/land cover changes in an accessible GIS platform can be used to
supplement the available tools for urban planning and environmental management in the

spatial relations represent distance (topological relations) and directional relations. 
This research discusses the role of topology for the conceptualization of different 
movement and furthermore to assess the influence of two different scales of spaces 
on cognitive classes through human subject tests. Two experiments are conducted 
with two different scales. Each experiment was performed by 20 participants. Experiments 
were fully based on the grouping paradigm. Grouping task enable to 
categorize the movement entities into groups and establish the cognitive categories 
or classes. Entities or movement patterns within a class are assumed to similar 
to one another but different from the entities in other classes. It is believed that 
the two scales of space are quite distinct in the ways people see and think about 
them in their mind (Downs and Stea, 1977). To assess the influence of scale on the 
cognitive classes, two different scales are assumed i. e bike and city and bike and 
park. Similarity measure and category construction of different movement patterns 
are assessed using both scales. All movement patterns were designed through conceptual 
neighborhood graph. The result of this experiment shows that different 
movement patterns are distinguished by the topological relations. This study not 
also presents the importance of the topology for conceptualization and perception 
of different movement patterns but also the influence of scale to distinguish the 
different movement pattern and to build cognitive classes. The main finding of this 
study is that the grouping behavior of Non- tangential proper part is found to be 
different in both scales. Direction relations are also an important aspect of spatial 
relations. Human beings use different angular information in their environment and 
derive information. This study not also assesses the conceptualization of different 
direction turns but also examine the category construction influenced by the two 
different scales. This research discusses the category construction of direction turns 
created in both scales. The results shows that human perceive different angular information and deduce this information. It is also examined that cognitive classes 
constructed remain same in both scale. Furthermore, linguistic description is also 
evaluated in this research but not in much detail. Verbal labeling of the groups

It resulted in the experiment that participants in both groups had difficulty following the absolute instructions. The A-R group showed more stops and deviations in the whole experiment for the shifting frame of reference. In terms of gender, women made few stops, few deviations, and did not walk off the route frequently based on the absolute or relative frame. A correlation between the result of Sta.

The study also reviewed population growth and urbanization trends in connection with increasing built up areas leading to the environmental degradation. The population growth and urbanization trend of Kathmandu valley was the highest among other cities in Nepal. Principal component analysis was applied to spectrally enhance images to get the better image classification results. Images were classified in six land use and land cover classes using supervised classification and maximum likelihood algorithm which were then re-classed into built up and non-built up to focus on urbanization. The analysis showed that the built up area had grown up to 134% in 2006 since 1989. The assessed overall accuracies for the classification of three images were between 86 to 89 percentages. Cellular Automata Markov (CA_MARKOV) and GEOMOD modeling programs were used to project the 2006 and then 2019 land use and land cover classes.

The remote sensing community has recognized the challenge in processing large and complex satellite datasets to derive customized products. To address this high demand in computational resources, several efforts have been made in the past few years towards incorporation of high-performance computing models in remote sensing data collection, management and analysis. This study adds an impetus to these efforts by introducing the recent advancements in distributed computing technologies, MapReduce programming paradigm, to the area of remote sensing. The MapReduce model which is developed by Google Inc. encapsulates the efforts of distributed computing in a highly simplified single library. This simple but powerful programming model can provide us distributed environment without having deep knowledge of parallel programming. This thesis presents a MapReduce based processing of large satellite images a use case scenario of edge detection methods. Deriving from the conceptual massive remote sensing image processing applications, a prototype of edge detection methods was implemented on MapReduce framework using its open-source implementation, the Apache Hadoop environment. The experiences of the implementation of the MapReduce model of Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny edge detection methods are presented.

features are prone to multiple, context-dependent conceptualizations reflecting local 
conditions. This creates semantic heterogeneity and undermines interoperability. Standardization 
of a shared definition is often employed to overcome semantic heterogeneity. 
However, this approach loses important local diversity in feature conceptualizations and 
may result in feature definitions which are too broad or too specific. This work proposes 
the use of microtheories in Spatial Data Infrastructures, such as INSPIRE, to account 
for diversity of local conceptualizations while maintaining interoperability at a global 
level. It introduces a novel method of structuring microtheories based on space and 
time, represented by administrative boundaries, to reflect variations in feature conceptualization. 
A bottom-up approach, based on non-standard inference, is used to create 
an appropriate global-level feature definition from the local definitions. Conceptualizations 
of rivers, forests and estuaries throughout Europe are used to demonstrate how 
the approach can improve the INSPIRE data model and ease its adoption by European

The overall result demonstrates that forest area has experienced a significant shrinkage and mostly transferred into agricultural and bare land from 1989 to 2005. Expected change for the year 2021 was projected using Markov Chain Analysis (MCA). The MCA result showed that forest area including shrub will be decreased by 8.5% during 2005-21."

Variations in the abundance within a species' geographic range provide the connection between the disciplines of ecology, geostatistics and biogeography. Species predictive modelling is quite intricate considering the spatial and aspatial variables that both play interactive roles in predicting a species' occurrence. Like many primates across Africa, Pan troglodytes ellioti has both the least geographic distribution and population relative to the other chimpanzee subspecies continent wide. With the proposed Mount Cameroon National Park as the study area, predictions displayed as maps further enhance spatial visualisation. Predictions in Maxent had an estimated accuracy assessment of approximately 0.7 and 67.41% being currently suitable respectively. The observed shift in the habitat suitability from lower to higher altitudes suggests climatic conditions prevailing in the suitable range will likely be attainable only at much higher altitudes in the future. A likely consequence on species shall be to ascend towards the summit in order to meet their needs both physiologically and resource wise."

One of the research challenges in the field of health is how pollen allergy variation depends on the geographic location of the patient. In this work we are motivated to show capabilities of geoinformation technologies in studies of pollen allergy. An analysis of the phenomenon of pollen allergy based on the project Alergologia-2005 and the example of allergy monitoring in the Hospital De Sagunto in Spain, allows to formulate requirements to the technologies used. The client application and server system, integrated in a web service, help scientists explore pollen allergy and attempt to handle it, as well as help patients to be able to control the disease. The designed client interface provides a platform for collecting volunteered geographic information (VGI) from people suffering from allergies and supply them with information about pollen counts. At the same time, the server side of the application provides secure storage of geoinformation and opportunities for its retrieval for analysis, including visualization on a map. Health practitioners can display information from patients and compare it with other characteristics of the place, such as weather conditions.

because the software is readily availability, secondly to create a simple interface that is more user 
friendly and meets the aim of improving participation levels. The method follows a traditional 
community meeting, where participants gather to make comments about a neighbourhood plan 
produced by Bugembe Town council. The plan from the web application, is projected on to a wall 
which is made sensitive to an interactive pen. The community maps their comments directly on the 
projection using the interactive pen. The comments are stored in a GIS database for the planner to 
retrieve and incorporate in the final plan. The usability assessments are done using questionnaires, 
recordings and physical checks. This is followed by engaging the communities in mapping landmarks 
in their areas, purposely, to understand their perceptions of space and representation of spatial 
features. 
The results are overwhelming as the communities easily map their boundaries on the web application 
using the interactive screen; the application was tested by people from all walks of life. 74 percent of 
the participants appreciated the application and found it easy to use. 
With the recommendations and wealth of information provided by the communities, the application 
will fetch enormous results in the field of public participation in Uganda, at the same time making the

Month algae bloom variation of MFI reflect the existing similar cicling dynamics of formation for each year. Lower values there are in the months of June and September, while the peaks occur in the hottest and less rainy months of July and August. We can clearly see that there are three different stages: operation of low level, rising phase, and fall period. We noted that there is a stronge influence of sea temperature in Mucilage formation. Series of consistent MODIS MI data products provide baseline information to monitor Italian coast Mucilage Formation, one of the critical water quality indicators, especially in the summer on a weekly basis, as well as to evaluate its future water quality trends."

mixed rangeland, grassland, farmland, built-up areas, bare soil and water. A 
combination of NDVI differencing, supervised and unsupervised classification was 
used to derive final classification maps. Due to the lack of ground truth data, further

There was a fire tragedy reported on January 28, 2013 in a night club in Brazil that many victims confused the exit sign with that for the toilet sign, where 50 bodies were found dead in toilet. It is reported that the victims lost their sense of direction due to the smoke [1]. Consequently the traditional static emergency signs are no longer effective especially in a complex building. They are not intelligent to decide how many people are using different exit, where the fire is and how much it may spread or how the evacuee will decide and think while they are in panic. They are several attempts to simulate the evacuation area and create a better model to dynamically lead the evacuee to exit. However creating such system is difficult because the prediction of behaviors in emergency incidents, modeling and examination in the real scenario are the biggest problems. Evacuation exercise are expensive and time consuming, as a result Virtual Environment (VEs) might be the feasible solution to create the emergency scenario and to study the physical, cognitive, and perceptual capabilities of the evacuees, letting them to experience and feel the emergency incident that are impossible to apply in the real world. This project presents the use of VE, called Immersive Video Environment (IVE) [2] to investigate and evaluate the possible dynamic signage inside a building to guide the evacuees to safety and exit. IVE system contains three screens with 140 degree from each other using 3 back projected wall at the same time. In this study dynamic signs inform the evacuee by following the exit signs cause of fire emergency and move towards the exit. Generally the user of VE is disoriented or discomforted due to navigation (Travel) part. As a result, following factors are evaluated by using some pre-defined questionnaire such as Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and NASA TLX: 
1. The pre-movement time or response time to the dynamic signs. 
2. Panic behavior or Decision making 
3. Comfort of the system due to navigation part. 
4. Performance of IVE 
5. Realism of the simulation 
8 scenarios have been managed for this experiment in which each of them last around 30 to 40 seconds for a trip from start point to the exit door. In the entire scenario, the exit signs will be varied. The test participants were 10 people (5 Female, 5 Male) who come from different countries not specially Germany. There were great considerable results of decision making in this study for example, there were several errors for the fire sign during the experiment besides the response time for the fire sign were highly more than the other designs. From the evaluator recognition, it is said that their response has been influenced by the exit door or the design of sign. Generally the performance and the comfort of the system show interesting results in the emergency simulation and footage video for VE. There were a significant different in term of discomfort between men and women and the results of their response time had significant difference. By users rating, the realism of the simulation has been confirmed. For response time experiment, some errors and significant variation were observed during the individual test. The IVE can be used for future experiment investigation such as way finding. The proposed system shall help to yield more reliable information about human behavior and decision making in emergency egress and creating a model. Locations, timing, duration and speed, helping from dynamic signs can be considered as decision-making process subject to emergency evacuation."

This goal underlies two main objectives. The first objective was to detect land surface temperature anomalies over time in respect to the day of the earthquake, and over space relative to the location of the earthquake epicentre. The other main objective was to determine whether the detected anomalies originated from the weather, or the earthquake. To meet these objectives, observations of remote sensing land surface temperature, near-ground air temperature and air temperature of multiple atmospheric levels were used. All the datasets were daily night-time observations extending to a period of five years, repeatedly from July 11, to August 31. 
All the observations of the three datasets were visualized in space and time to seek anomalous temperature patterns. The results showed several prominent land surface temperature increases over the 5-year period, but none of them fell out a few days before the earthquake. The most enduring land surface temperature increase occurred two days after the earthquake. In contrast to the land surface temperature, air temperature exhibited the sharpest anomalies of the entire period a few days before the earthquake. Both the air and the land surface temperature increased periodically few times within the 5-year period. The high temperature patterns that were detected in the near-ground air also matched in time with the patterns found in the temperature of multiple atmospheric levels. 
All three approaches undertaken in this study were consistent with each-other in terms of results. Based on those results, it was concluded that there were no land surface temperature anomalies in the expected few days before the earthquake. All the detected temperature increases were indeed seasonal patterns repeating roughly in the same period of the year, and in the same spatial extent and intensity. These warm patterns were due to normal weather cycles. The sharp air temperature anomalies detected in the few days preceding the earthquake may suggest that the focus, if thermal precursors exist at all, should indeed be set on the air temperature instead of land surface temperature."

interlinking it with other related datasets, which are already on the cloud. 
Over all, the system have more than 21,000 triples with a SPARQL

Results were compared between the two interface groups and individual difference, such as gender and sense of direction abilities, were taken into account. 
The results do not indicate a significant difference between the two interfaces in relocation to orientation abilities. However, considerable differences among the interface groups were found with relation to gender and senses of direction. Moreover, a significant difference was found between groups in relation to user-map interaction.

Therefore, understanding and quantifying the spatio- temporal dynamics of urban land use and land cover changes and its driving factors is essential to put forward the right policies and monitoring mechanisms on urban growth for decision making. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze land use and land cover changes in Bahir Dar area, Ethiopia by applying geospatial and land use change modeling tools. In order to achieve this, satellite data of Landsat TM for 1986 and ETM for 2001 and 2010 have been obtained and preprocessed using ArcGIS. The Maximum Liklihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification has been used to generate land use and land cover maps. For the accuracy of classified land use and land cover maps, a confusion matrix was used to derive overall accuracy and results were above the minimum and acceptable threshold level. The generated land cover maps have been run with Land Change Modeler for quantifying land use and land cover changes, to examine land use transitions between land cover classes, to identify gain and losses of built up areas in relation to other land cover classes and to asses spatial trend of built up areas. Finally, Land Change Modeler has been run to model land use and land cover changes in Bahir Dar area and to predict future urban land use changes. To achieve this, four model variables that explain urban growth and six land cover transitions were incorporated in the modeling process. Multi-layer perceptron neural network was used to model the transition potential maps and achieved an accuracy of 61%. This result was acceptable to make actual prediction using Markov chain analysis for year 2010. Validation results showed that the model (Land Change Modeler) had a lower accuracy in simulating changes for the year 2010. Generally, the results of this study have shown that there was an increased expansion of built up areas in the last 25 years from 1.5% in 1986 to 4.1 % in 2001 and 9.4% in 2010 at the expense of agricultural areas.

application. Forestry and environmental problems, with their strong territorial 
implications, are especially suitable to be analyzed applying these technologies. 
In order to create an application with spatial processes, we propose a framework with a 
layered service-based architecture. It is layered because its structure is divided in a set 
of functional layers: the user layer (geoportal or client), the service layer (inside the 
server) and the data layer (spatial database). The access and processing of spatial data is 
accomplished through adequate service standards of OGC (Open Geospatial 
Consortium): Web Map Services (WMS), Web Feature Services (WFS), Web Coverage 
Services (WCS) and Web Processing Services (WPS). 
We implement a complete forestry   related application from scratch that offers access, 
visualization, querying and processing of spatial data and an active user interaction. The 
key of the application is WPS. Additionally, other processing solutions (like making 
queries with the spatial database) are discussed. 
In brief, this work presents an overview of the current technology and possible solutions 
for integrating spatial processes on the web and proposes some guidelines to implement 
them in a fully working system."

For infrastructure design, these maps are combined with existing hurricane wind speed studies, to be used as input loads due to wind. 
For each station with non-thunderstorm wind speeds time histories in the input data, following (Pintar, Simiu, Lombardo, & Levitan, 2015), extreme wind speeds corresponding to each MRI are calculated using a Peaks Over Threshold Poisson Process POT-PP extreme value model, then wind velocities with the same MRI are spatially interpolated to generate continuous maps for the whole study area. The annual exceedance probability for all velocity values in 700, 1700 and 3000 years MRIs output maps are respectively 1/700, 1/1700 and 1/3000. 
Regarding input data, not only time series of field measurements from IDEAM methodological stations are used, but also post-processed information coming from the Integrated Surface Database ISD, and ERA5 forecast reanalysis data. This condition demanded a comparison of the different data sources, in order to verify the feasibility in the use of ISD and ERA5, this is downscaling support. The result of the comparison showed little similarity between the different sources, but taking into account that complete and adequate measured data from IDEAM was not available. Before to apply POT-PP, ISD and IDEAM data sources were standardized to meet the requirement of three seconds (3-s) wind gust speed, ten (10) meters anemometer height, and terrain open space condition. 
Due to the limitation in the classification of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm data, it was not possible to take real advantage of POT-PP method, which was limited/restricted from non-homogeneous to homogeneous and from non-stationary to stationary, being equivalent to use the most common POT - generalized Pareto approach. Non-hurricane maps were created for data sources ISD and ERA5, using Kriging as spatial interpolation method. After the integration with previous hurricane studies, the results of ERA5 showed the most reliable final maps, despite limitations in the input data to guarantee downscaling support. ISD final 
map showed very high wind values, which are unlikely. These shortcomings may be corrected when complete IDEAM data-source and storm data classification are available.

Traffic congestion, long commuting, parking difficulties, automobile dependence, high infrastructure maintenance costs, poor public transportation, and loss of public space are some of the problems that afflict major metropolitan areas. Trying to provide a solution for the future inner-city transportation, several companies have worked in recent years to design aircraft prototypes that base their technology on current UAVs. Therefore, vehicles with electrical Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) technology are rapidly emerging so that they can be included in the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) system. For this to become a reality, space agencies, governments and academics are generating concepts and recommendations to be considered a safe means of transportation for citizens. However, one of the most relevant points for this future implementation is the suitable location of the potential UAM hubs within the metropolitan areas. Since although UAM vehicles can take advantage of infrastructure such as roofs of buildings to clear and land, several criteria must be considered to find the ideal location. 
As a solution, this thesis seeks to carry out an integral rooftop-place suitability analysis by involving both the essential variables of the urban ecosystem and the adequate rooftop surfaces for UAM operability. The study area selected for this research is Manhattan (New York, U.S), which is the most densely populated metropolitan area of one of the megacities in the world. The applied methodology has an unsupervised-data-driving and GIS-based approach, which is covered in three sections. The first part is responsible for analyzing the suitability of place when evaluating spatial patterns given by the application of Self-Organizing Maps on the urban ecosystem variables attached to the city census blocks. The second part is based on the development of an algorithm in Python for both the evaluation of the flatness of the roof surfaces and the definition of the UAM platform type suitable for its settlement. The final stage performs a combined analysis of the suitability indexes generated for the development of UAM hubs. Results reflect that 16% of the roofs in the study area have high integral suitability for the development of UAM hubs, where UAVs platforms and Vertistops (small size platforms) are the types that can be the most settled in Manhattan.

This demographic transition from rural to urban is expected to have a continuous increase. Governments, especially in less developed countries, are going to face more challenges in different sectors, raising the essence of understanding the spatial pattern of the growth for an effective urban planning. 
The study aimed to detect, analyse and model the urban growth in Greater Cairo Region (GCR) as one of the fast growing mega cities in the world using remote sensing data. Knowing the current and estimated urbanization situation in GCR will help decision makers in Egypt to adjust their plans and develop new ones. These plans should focus on resources reallocation to overcome the problems arising in the future and to achieve a sustainable development of urban areas, especially after the high percentage of illegal settlements which took place in the last decades. 
The study focused on a period of 30 years; from 1984 to 2014, and the major transitions to urban were modelled to predict the future scenarios in 2025. Three satellite images of different time stamps (1984, 2003 and 2014) were classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier, then the land cover changes were detected by applying a high level mapping technique. Later the results were analyzed for higher accurate estimations of the urban growth in the future in 2025 using Land Change Modeler (LCM) embedded in IDRISI software. Moreover, the spatial and temporal urban growth patterns were analyzed using statistical metrics developed in FRAGSTATS software. 
The study resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 96%, 97.3% and 96.3% for 1984, 2003 and 2014  map, respectively. Between 1984 and 2003, 19 179 hectares of vegetation and 21 417 hectares of desert changed to urban, while from 2003 to 2014, the transitions to urban from both land cover classes were found to be 16 486 and 31 045 hectares, respectively. The model results indicated that 14% of the vegetation and 4% of the desert in 2014 will turn into urban in 2025, representing 16 512 and 24 687 hectares, respectively."

One of the main sources of greenhouse gas is energy consumption, therefore a number of initiatives and calls for awareness and sustainability in energy use are issued among different types of institutional and organizations. The European Council adopted in 2007 energy and climate change objectives for 20% improvement until 2020. All European countries are required to use energy with more efficiency. Several steps could be conducted for energy reduction: understanding the buildings behavior through time, revealing the factors that influence the consumption, applying the right measurement for reduction and sustainability, visualizing the hidden connection between our daily habits impacts on the natural world and promoting to more sustainable life. Researchers have suggested that feedback visualization can effectively encourage conservation with energy reduction rate of 18%. Furthermore, researchers have contributed to the identification process of a set of factors which are very likely to influence consumption. Such as occupancy level, occupants behavior, environmental conditions, building thermal envelope, climate zones, etc. 
Nowadays, the amount of energy consumption at the university campuses are huge and it needs great effort to meet the reduction requested by European Council as well as the cost reduction. Thus, the present study was performed on the university buildings as a use case to: 
a. Investigate the most dynamic influence factors on energy consumption in campus; b. Implement prediction model for electricity consumption using different techniques, such as the traditional regression way and the alternative machine learning techniques; and c. Assist energy management by providing a real time energy feedback and visualization in campus for more awareness and better decision making. 
This methodology is implemented to the use case of University Jaume I (UJI), located in Castellon, Spain."

The analytic hierarchy process is one of many multi-criteria decision analysis methods that can be used to support these complex problems. Using its capabilities we try to develop a spatial decision support system, to help land use management. Land use management can undertake a broad spectrum of spatial decision problems. The developed decision support system had to accept as input, various formats and types of data, raster or vector format, and the vector could be polygon line or point type. The support system was designed to perform its analysis for the Zambezi river Valley in Mozambique, the study area. The possible solutions for the emerging problems had to cover the entire region.

Policy makers and on ground NGOs need to tackle the hazard of floods in an effective and efficient manner. Recent research demonstrated the capabilities and potentials of remote sensing in flood hazard and risk mapping. This study aims to map flood hazard and assess the risk of floods in state of Khartoum, Sudan. In order to identify the flood hazard in state counties, an inundation indicator is used, namely the relative frequency of inundation (RFI). 
Flood events that occurred from 1988 to 2018 were mapped using Landsat satellite images, and maximum flood extent was then delineated. RFI was obtained using maximum flood extent maps and served as the flood hazard map. We developed a Land Cover Land Use (LCLU) map using Landsat 8 to identify affected urban and croplands areas in the state of Khartoum. RFI values was used along with LCLU map to assess state counties, and to assess the vulnerability of public facilities (health and educational facilities) using zonal statistics. It was demonstrated that, in terms of average RFI values for LCLU classes per county, croplands had the highest flood hazard, and Urban areas carried a relatively moderate flood hazard. The results of this study indicate that croplands on the riverbanks are the most inundated areas in the state of Khartoum, and the most urbanized counties have the highest flood hazard."

A great deal of research has been conducted to find out whether there is a relationship between LULC and carbon sequestration. In this paper we explore several scenarios and compare how much carbon would be stored under each of them. In addition, this research aims to find out how best the LULUCF sector can contribute towards a country  goals in achieving carbon neutrality. This was conducted using two models; Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model, which calculates the amount of carbon stored in a landscape and TerrSet  Land Change Modeller, which uses a combination of neural networks and CA Markov to project future Land Use Land Cover (LULC) scenarios. From the documentation of the carbon trend over the 28-year period using the InVEST model, the study finds that between the years of 1990 and 2018, the amount of carbon stored increased by 0.15%. Under the Business as Usual scenario projection there is an increase of 0.22% by the year 2048. In the development scenario we see a decrease of 0.96% and finally in the two conservation scenarios the carbon stock increases by 4.16% and 0.41% respectively. These results suggest that the scenario which would be most beneficial to Germany would be the first conservation scenario. The results of this study highlight the importance of the LULUCF sector in mitigating climate change. Therefore, they can be used to provide informed decision making to spatial planners and land management stakeholders during the development of future land use planning policies."

Places carry meanings for individuals, communities or even nations evidenced by bonds referred collectively as sense of place. Dissecting sense of place can aid planners in providing a social-psychological layer of the world characterized by the distinct relationships people possess towards the physical settings. In this research, different dimensions of sense of place experienced by foreign residents in the city of Lisbon were investigated through a map-based survey and following spatial analysis. 
First, the map-based survey was structured on sense of place dimensions drawn from the environmental psychology and human geography research. The dimensions examined here were: (i) place dependence   functional attachment; (ii) place awareness   familiarity and exploration; (iii) place identity   special bonds and self-identity (iv) place inherited   rootedness and belongingness. The survey was shared online among international residents of the city and hand-drawn polygons were processed in order to represent the spatial lay-outs of sense of place. Subsequently, answers were split into two participant categories: short-terms and long-terms. Overlay analysis, spatial comparison metrics, cluster evaluation, statistics and the confection of map products were carried out in order to compare and visualize the distinct sense of place components. 
Results, discussion and interpretation were brought forward through comparing dimensions between participant groups; between dimensions themselves, as well as identifying meaningful places within the urban landscape. The spatial imprint of sense of place in the specified context of study provided insights regarding the distinction between groups. Long-term and short-term dwellers  geographic dimensions of sense of place were found to have different patterns, properties and characteristics.

Addressing environmental impacts related to this major challenge requires faster and more efficient planning strategies that are based on measured information on land-use patterns. This study was employed to access the ecological risk index of Zanzibar using land cover change. We first employed Random Forest classifier to classify three Landsat images of Zanzibar for the year 2003, 2009 and 2018. And then the land change modeler was employed to simulate the land cover for Zanzibar City up to 2027 from land-use maps of 2009 and 2018 under business-as-usual and other two alternative scenarios (conservation and extreme scenario). Next, the ecological risk index of Zanzibar for each land cover was assessed based on the theories of landscape ecology and ecological risk model. The results show that the built-up areas and farmland of Zanzibar island have been increased constantly, while the natural grassland and forest cover were shrinking. The forest, agricultural and grassland have been highly fragmented into several small patches relative to the decrease in their patch areas. On the other hand, the ecological risk index of Zanzibar island has appeared to increase at a constant rate and if the current trend continues this index will increase by up to 8.9% in 2027. In comparing the three future scenarios the results show that the ERI for the conservation scenario will increase by only 4.6% which is at least 1.6% less compared to 6.2% of the business as usual, while the extreme scenario will provide a high increase of ERI of up to 8.9%. This study will help authorities to understand ecological processes and land use dynamics of various land cover classes, along with preventing unmanaged growth and haphazard development of informal housing and infrastructure."

However, they have low accuracy in an Area of Interest (ROI) due to their coarse spatial resolution (i.e., pixel size > 250m). The Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission from the European Spatial Agency (ESA) provides free data access for Sentinel 2-A(S2a) and B (S2b). This satellite constellation guarantees a high temporal (5-day revisit cycle) and high spatial resolution (10m), allowing frequent updates on land cover products through supervised classification. Nevertheless, this requires training samples that are traditionally collected manually via fieldwork or image interpretation. This thesis aims to implement an automatic workflow to classify land cover and crop types at 10m resolution in central Portugal using existing databases, intra-annual time series of S2a and S2b, and Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm. The agricultural classes such as temporary and permanent crops as well as agricultural grasslands were extracted from the Portuguese Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) of the Instituto de Financiamento da Agricultura e Pescas (IFAP); land cover classes like urban, forest and water were trained from the Carta de OcupaÁ?o do Solo (COS) that is the national Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map of Portugal; and lastly, the burned areas are identified from the corresponding national map of the Instituto da ConservaÁ?o da Natureza e das Florestas (ICNF). Also, a set of preprocessing steps were defined based on the implementation of ancillary data allowing to avoid the inclusion of mislabeled pixels to the classifier. Mislabeling of pixels can occur due to errors in digitalization, generalization, and differences in the Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) between datasets. An inner buffer was applied to all datasets to reduce border overlap among classes; the mask from the ICNF was applied to remove burned areas, and NDVI rule based on Landsat 8 allowed to erase recent clear-cuts in the forest. Also, the Copernicus High-Resolution Layers (HRL) datasets from 2015 (latest available), namely Dominant Leaf Type (DLT) and Tree Cover Density (TCD) are used to distinguish between forest with more than 60% coverage (coniferous and broadleaf) such as Holm Oak and Stone Pine and between 10 and 60% (coniferous) for instance Open Maritime Pine. Next, temporal gap-filled monthly composites were created for the agricultural period in Portugal, ranging from October 2017 till September 2018. The composites provided data free of missing values in opposition to single date acquisition images. Finally, a pixel-based approach classification was carried out in the  Tejo and Sado  ù region of Portugal using Random Forest (RF). The resulting map achieves a 76% overall accuracy for 31 classes (17 land cover and 14 crop types). The RF algorithm captured the most relevant features for the classification from the cloud-free composites, mainly during the spring and summer and in the bands on the Red Edge, NIR and SWIR. Overall, the classification was more successful on the irrigated temporary crops whereas the grasslands presented the most complexity to classify as they were confused with other rainfed crops and burned areas."

This thesis consists of an integrated three-steps approach to analyze spatial data  impact over the mid-term room rent, choosing Lisbon as its case study. The proposed methodology constitutes use of traditional spatial econometric models and SVR, encompassing a large set of proxies for amenities that might be recognized to hold a possible impact over rent prices. The analytical frameworks  first step is to create a suitable HPM model that captures the data well, so significant variables can be detected and analyzed as a discrete dataset. The second step applies subsets of the dataset in the creation of SVR models, in hopes of identifying the SVs influencing price variances. Finally, SOM clusters are chosen to address whether more natural order of data division exists. Results confirm the impact of proximity to various categories of amenities, but the enrichment of models with the proposed proxies of spatial data failed to corroborate attainment of model with a higher accuracy.

Cities are expanding across the countryside at the expense of productive land. Such urban sprawl has incurred adverse environmental consequences affecting quality of life of urban residents in the valley. Recently, Kathmandu has been identified to be on the verge of climate change, especially in the context of urban warming. Thus exploring the impact of urban growth on land surface temperature could be an effective means to unveil environmental issues caused by anthropogenic activities. This can be useful for the urban planners in urban planning and management as well as to raise public awareness regarding urban warming effect. Advancement in thermal Remote Sensing, GIS and statistical procedure has enabled monitoring land surface temperature and its correlation to land use and land cover. To analyze such relationship, we performed supervised classification and change detection to determine the spatial trend of land use and land cover change. After that we obtained the spatial pattern of LST using thermal band of Landsat images. Then we applied regression analysis to explore the relationship between surface temperature and land surface characteristics including both land use land cover types and land use and land cover indices. Based upon our analysis, we found that urban area has increased considerably by 259% during the period 1988-2014. The surface temperatures were found to be greater for bare soil and urban land use types. The regression analysis showed positive correlation between urban growth and LST.

Over the past decades, several methods were applied to study the effect of different factors on the way people acquire spatial knowledge. 
Through a pointing task, this study attempts to investigate the influence of spatial barriers on human survey knowledge in an outdoor environment. The task involved pointing from the same origin to targets in two separate conditions: one target lies across a barrier and another with no barrier in the pointing direction. The experiment was conducted in three locations: two in Muenster city and one in Dortmund city. A total of 204 random subjects participated in the whole experiments. In each location, the number of subjects participating was divided into two equal groups, each group pointing in only one separate condition. Subjects were asked to give an estimation of the direction to the target using a 360 ∞ dial, followed by a question about the direction they would go to get to that target. Pointing errors away from the target were calculated and analysed. 
Preliminary results of the study highlighted interesting patterns in the distribution of pointing error in each condition. One major finding of the study reveals that participants made a higher error in case of pointing across a barrier. In two of the study locations, the results show that in such a case, the pointing error is more biased in accordance with people  path preference when crossing a barrier to reach a destination, while this effect was not observed in the third location. 
The study suggests a new viewpoint of understanding how barriers can have an impact on survey knowledge acquisition, and therefore, opens the door to more comprehensive research on this effect. The results also imply that in some cases, such an effect might need to be considered in the process of developing orientation-based applications."

Regarding the forecasted increase in CO2-Emissions from Road Freight Transportation, this sector needs to undertake responsibilities for its environmental impact. Although technical and strategic solutions to reduce emissions have been introduced or are in development, such solutions rarely yield instant emission reduction potentials. A strategic approach to reduce them instantly, based on the given infrastructure and existing vehicle fleet, is represented through route optimization. Route optimization is a well-researched topic in the transportation domain. However, it is mainly used to reduce transportation times and expenses. Rising expectation towards sustainability through stakeholders such as authorities and consumers, let to an increased interest in route optimization where environmental externalities as fuel consumption and CO2-Emissions are minimized. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System (GIS) based 3D-Routing-Model, which incorporates models to estimate vehicle fuel consumption while taking effects as road inclination and varying velocities into account. The proposed model utilizes a Digital Elevation Model to enrich a Road Network with elevation data   An approach which is applicable to any area where respective data is available. To evaluate the effects of road inclination on a vehicles fuel consumption and its proportional CO2-Emissions, the 3D-Routing-Model is applied in different distribution scenarios within the framework of an artificial company in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. The obtained results indicate that eco-friendly routes can yield significant fuel and emission saving potentials of up to 20 % in the tested scenarios. However, the results also indicate that eco-friendly routes are characterized through longer distances as well as operation times, which eventually leads to increased expenses. It remains the question if companies within the transportation sector are more interested in maximizing their profits, or to invest in a sustainable future."

The theories around tornados are always coupled with an attempt to predict their occurrence, for better disaster alertness, and response, in case they happen. At the country level, the tornado occurrence is highly studied and understood. But the same does not happen for the state level, or county level. In this thesis, it is proposed a statistical model to characterize the occurrence of tornados in a state, given physical (terrain roughness and land-cover types)and demographic properties of its counties. This model also takes into consideration the spatial and temporal dimensions, as well as a space time interaction component. This model was applied for Oklahoma and Texas. The model with the covariates fits Texas tornado occurrence, but for Oklahoma, only the spatio-temporal formulation can be applied. For Texas, the model explains the covariates as being congruent with the low-level inflow hypothesis, with tornados decreasing in zones where natural barriers for the flow can be constituted. Under the Bayesian framework, maps of spatial risk and probability of tornado occurrence for Texas and Oklahoma were computed, that can be used to make predictions in the future."

Nevertheless, the traditional monitoring equipment is very expensive, and the available measurements are not sufficient to precisely classify air quality in several locations in a city. Recent advancements in air quality measuring technology provide a potential opportunity to increase the air quality data, and to raise public awareness of health issues arising from air pollution. This study focuses on the development and evaluation of a new prototype for the monitoring of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). It describes the design approach and the evaluation methods, in which a series of field experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the prototype and of a commercial low-cost device in comparison with a reference monitor. The results showed that the prototype presented a good performance in environments with a high variation of particle concentrations (variations above 100?g/m?), such as cooking-environments and exposure to cigarette smoke, for most of the experiments (R ? = 0.55-0.85). However, their agreement was very poor in environments without high variability of particle concentrations. The performance comparison between identical sensors purchased in the same year revealed a very high agreement (R ? = 0.92), but prototypes which utilized sensors acquired in different years presented a very weak correlation in most of the experiments. The analysis of the commercial low-cost device  performance revealed a moderate to strong linear correlation with the reference monitor in all the experiments (R= 0.51-0.93); this study also demonstrates that the maximum limit of detection of the device was much lower than the value given by the manufacturer (approximately 180?g/m?, in contrast to the value of 400?g/m?). For applications of real-time measurements, the prototype developed in this research may be especially utilized as indicative of PM2.5 hotspots and trends in ambient conditions, primarily in residences, monitoring the frequency and duration of high exposure events, such as cooking, smoking, and biomass burning. Nevertheless, this research demonstrates the necessity for individual sensor performance testing prior to field use, and that presumptions about the representativeness of measurements of PM2.5 carried out by low-cost sensors should be made with caution."

agriculture resources. In the last decade, the Government of Indonesia has focused on the 
production development of 4F crops, meaning crops for the production of Food, Feed, 
Fiber, and Fuel. In 2014, Indonesia had about 101 million hectares agricultural land which 
comprised of approximately 47 million hectares cultivated area and the remaining 54 
million hectares were expandable agriculture lands. However, the expansion has to 
consider Indonesia Law No. 44 in Year 2009 (Undang   Undang No 4 Tahun 2009) 
regarding the security of sustainable food cropland that restricts the conversion of food 
cropland into timber forest, industry or settlements. In fact, unwanted land use land cover 
(LULC) change happened due to the excessive expansion of oil palm, rubber, pulpwood 
and mining industries particularly in East Kalimantan. Two districts that exhibit significant 
LULC change are Kutai Barat and Mahakam Ulu. An additional 78.5 thousand ha of 
rubber, 31 thousand ha of oil palm and 23.6 thousand ha of pulpwood plantations have 
dominated the LULC change in Kutai Barat and Mahakam Ulu districts from 1990 to 2009. 
Although in general, the agricultural expansion has become the main cause of unwanted 
LULC change and forest cover loss, these have also contributed to positive economic 
benefit. In order to evaluate the economic benefit of historic agricultural expansion as well 
as to estimate the economic benefit of future agricultural expansion, it is necessary to look 
thoroughly at the geographic distribution of crop yields within the districts because we 
would like to understand the crop yield for every agriculture production area. The issue on 
the existing crop statistic data is that the crop statistics are conveyed as tabular-based data 
and reported at the national, provincial or district level of detail. Thus, examining crop 
distribution in district level is certainly challenging. Hence, a spatial crop yield allocation 
model was applied to generate pixel-level crop yield representation of Kutai Barat and 
Mahakam Ulu districts in 2000 and 2009 based upon available the regional crop statistics 
data and the existing LULC maps and further analyze its spatial-temporal pattern within 
this period of time. Furthermore, an evaluation of crop yield production and the agriculture 
2 
expansion trend from 2000 to 2009 were applied to a 2030 land use projection from a land 
use change model to project the pixel level crop yield in 2030. Between 2000 and 2009, 
rubber plantation exhibits land expansion and followed by the increase of yield. While the 
expansion of oil palm in 2009 is followed by the degradation of yield. We presume this 
due to the oil palm plantation in 2009 is still in early harvesting stage. The accuracy of 
disaggregation model is highly depending on the quality of data particularly crop statistic 
data and LULC map. The deviation between these two data leads to the occurrence of a 
high error in disaggregation results. By estimating oil palm and rubber yield based on 
projected LULC maps in 2030, the future expansion is suggested to follow the Limited 
Unrestricted scenario since this scenario is able to provide highest average yield with 
relatively small area among other scenarios. In this manner, either government or people 
in Kutai Barat and Mahakam Ulu are able to gain optimal agricultural benefit without 
sacrificing an excessive number of land resources."

Pixel based image analysis approaches for classifying land cover classes are compared using three supervised classification algorithms: maximum likelihood (ML), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Concerning the comparison between different classification predictions, the McNemar test indicated that the observed difference between the two machine learning algorithms (RF and SVM) was not statistically significant (p = 0.2278 > 0.05). However, there was not a statistical significant difference (p > 0.05) in classification accuracy between map produced using SVM algorithm and RF algorithm. Classification based on SVM and RF algorithms produced map that is more visually adequate depiction of land cover classes than that produced by ML algorithm. Overall, two machine learning algorithms seems superior than ML algorithm in land cover classification using medium spatial resolution imagery in term of performance based on classification accuracy."

however, in all these contributions a good accuracy is always paid at the price of extremely

a framework which balances maximum accuracy with less network complexity. The modern 
activation function called Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) is applied to improve the performance 
of the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), resulting in more, yet accurate building prediction. To 
further reduce the noise (false classified buildings) and to sharpen the boundary of the buildings, 
a post processing CRF is added at the end of the adopted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
framework. The experiments were conducted on Massachusetts building aerial imagery. The 
results show that our proposed framework outperformed FCN baseline, which is the existing 
baseline framework for semantic segmentation, in term of performance measure, the F1-score 
and Intersection Over Union (IoU) measure. Additionally, the proposed method stood superior to 
the pre-existing classifier for building extraction using the same dataset in terms of performance 
measure and network complexity at once."

Earlier studies have shown that remote sensing techniques, with the help of very-high resolution imagery, can play a significant role in detecting slums, and providing timely spatial information. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a reliable object-oriented slum identification technique that enables the provision of timely spatial information about slum settlements in Addis Ababa city. It compares the one-class support vector machines algorithm with the expert defined classification rule set in the discrimination of slums, using GeoEye-1 imagery. Two different approaches, called manual and automatic fine-tuning, were deployed to determine the best value of parameters in one-class support vector machines algorithm. The manual fine-tuning of the parameters is done using extensive manual trial. The automatic tuning is done using cross-validation grid search with the overall accuracy as the performance metric. Two regions of study were defined with different landscape compositions, providing different classification scenarios to compare the classification approaches. After image segmentation, twenty predictive variables were computed to characterize the objects in both study areas. An image analyst collected one hundred sample objects of a slum to be used as training for the single-class learner. In parallel, an image analyst has defined a hierarchical rule set to discriminate the class of interest. Results in both study areas indicate that the one-class support vector machine with manual tuning yields higher overall accuracy (97.7% in subset 1, and 92% in subset 2) and requiring much less application effort and computing time than the expert system."

Several global land cover maps have been produced recently namely, Global Land Cover Share (GLC-Share) and GlobeLand30. These datasets are very useful sources of land cover information and potential users and producers are many times interested in comparing these datasets. However these global land cover maps are produced based on different techniques and using different classification schemes making their interoperability in a standardized way a challenge. The Environmental Information and Observation Network (EIONET) Action Group on Land Monitoring in Europe (EAGLE) concept was developed in order to translate the differences in the classification schemes into a standardized format which allows a comparison between class definitions. This is done by elaborating an EAGLE matrix for each classification scheme, where a bar code is assigned to each class definition that compose a certain land cover class. Ahlqvist (2005) developed an overlap metric to cope with semantic uncertainty of geographical concepts, providing this way a measure of how geographical concepts are more related to each other. In this paper, the comparison of global land cover datasets is done by translating each land cover legend into the EAGLE bar coding for the Land Cover Components of the EAGLE matrix. The bar coding values assigned to each class definition are transformed in a fuzzy function that is used to compute the overlap metric proposed by Ahlqvist (2005) and overlap matrices between land cover legends are elaborated. The overlap matrices allow the semantic comparison between the classification schemes of each global land cover map. The proposed methodology is tested on a case study where the overlap metric proposed by Ahlqvist (2005) is computed in the comparison of two global land cover maps for Continental Portugal. The study resulted with the overlap spatial distribution among the two global land cover maps, Globeland30 and GLC-Share. These results shows that Globeland30 product overlap with a degree of 77% with GLC-Share product in Continental Portugal."

This thesis defines a workflow aimed at deriving Cadastral Geospatial Information (Cadastral GI), as three-dimensional (3D) building volumes from the original inputted UAS imagery. To achieve this, an investigation was done to see how crowd-sourced UAS data can be uploaded to open online repositories, downloaded by Cadastral Experts, and then manipulated using open source applications. The Cadastral Experts had to utilise multiple applications and manipulate the data through many data formats, to obtain the (3D) building volumes as final results. Such a product can potentially improve the management of cadastral data by Cadastral Experts, City Managers and National Mapping Agencies. Additionally, an ideal suite of tools is presented, that can be used store, manipulate and share the 3D building volume data while facilitating the contribution of attribute data from the crowd."

After an earthquake, most casualties are found in or under collapsed buildings. With limited nutritional resources and potential injuries, survival rates decrease rapidly after 72hrs. To quickly and accurately assess the overall and individual damage grade of buildings is therefore of fundamental importance to the recovery of victims. The utilised strategies of USAR teams are currently challenged by several limitations. Virtual Reality has been used to visualise three-dimensional data across many scientific research areas. The special characteristics of VR allow a more immersive and engaged interaction for the user. So far VR has been utilised to train USAR personnel, but it has not been applied as a data visualisation method. This concept could support USAR teams across the globe by enabling them to assess overall structural damage extent, visually inspect inaccessible areas and identify optimal access points in a three-dimensional environment. This thesis therefore compares standard USAR approaches, such as Street View images, 2D aerial images and videos, to 3D building models in Virtual Reality. A user study was conducted to investigate the accuracy of information obtained from the different USAR methods, as well as the time it took for the users to obtain the required information. After an explorative data analysis, a Friedman test followed by a Wilcoxon test was applied to results of the user study. The results of the test showed a significant difference between VR and Aerial Imagery. However, the trends in average task completion time as well as task completion rate suggest that VR can be identified as a useful tool to Urban Search and Rescue, improving both temporal requirement and accuracy assessment in comparison to current methods."

Random Forest algorithms have shown high potential for land cover mapping problems yet have not been sufficiently tested on their ability to process and classify multi-temporal data within one classification process. Additionally, a growing amount of geospatial data is freely available online without having their usability assessed, such as EUROSTAT és LUCAS land use land cover dataset. This study provides a comparative analysis of two land cover classification approaches using Random Forest on open-access multi-spectral, multi-temporal Sentinel-2A/B data. A classification system composed of six classes (sealed surfaces, non-vegetated unsealed surfaces, water, woody, herbaceous permanent, herbaceous periodic) was designed for this study. Ten images of ten bands plus NDVI each, taken between November 2016 and October 2017 in Central Portugal, were processed in R using a pixel-based approach. Ten maps based on single month data were produced. These were then used as input data for the classifier to create a final map. This map was compared with a map using all 100 bands at once as training for the classifier. This study concluded that the approach using all bands produced maps with 11% higher, yet overall low accuracy of 58%. It was also less time-consuming with about 5 hours to over 15 hours of work for the multi-temporal predictions. The main causes for the low accuracy identified by this thesis are uncertainties with EUROSTAT és Land Use/Cover Area Statistical Survey (LUCAS) training data and issues with the accompanying nomenclature definition. Additional to the comparison of the classification approaches, the usability of LUCAS (2015) is tested by comparing four different variations of it as training data for the classification based on 100 bands. 
This research indicates high potential of using Sentinel-2 imagery and multi-temporal stacks of bands to achieve an averaged land cover classification of the investigated time span. Moreover, the research points out lower potential of the multi-map approach and issues regarding the suitability of using LUCAS open-access data as sole input for training a classifier for this study. Issues include inaccurate surveying and a partially long distance between the marked point and the actual observation point reached by the surveyors of up to 1.5 km. Review of the database, additional sampling and ancillary data appears to be necessary for achieving accurate results."

Consequently, the integrated protection of these ecosystems from forest fires is of high priority.

Thus, fire risk modeling is combined with visibility analysis, so that we may primarily protect the most susceptible territory of the study area. The corner stone of the methodology is primarily relied on the multi-criteria decision analysis. This framework applied not only for the fire risk estimation and the corresponding evolution in a context of 20 years, but for visibility analysis as well, determining the most suitable locations for the establishment of a minimum number of watchtowers. The fire risk map for 2016 indicated that 34% of the entire study area is covered by territory of low fire risk; 27% of moderate risk; 34% of high and very high risk, while there is a 6% of the island which is characterized by extremely fire risk. Similar conclusions can be drawn for 1996, since no significant changes have been observed, especially on the land cover types and their spatial arrangement. Based on the visibility results, more than 40% of the entire island is visible from the selected location scheme consisting of just 8 watchtowers. The intense topography constituted the most critical barrier in increasing this percentage. Some good practices to counterbalance the relative small percentage of visibility could include; the extensive patrols in unmonitored regions through the intense road network of the island; the adoption of drones covering the aforementioned areas, especially when extreme meteorological conditions are expected."

This is due to its unique geographic location, dominance of floodplains, low elevation, high population density, high levels of poverty, and overwhelming dependence on nature for its resources and services. The country experiences severe flood and cyclone events and, in recent years, water logging has become a catastrophic problem along the coast. These coastal areas play important economic and environmental roles in the country. 
The present paper attempts to show the extent of water logged areas, caused by sea level rise and the sectoral impacts of settlement, agriculture and fisheries in the south-western coastal areas of Bangladesh. A multi-temporal analysis method has been used with remote sensing (LandSat 1975 and LandSat 2000) data. SRTM data has been used to show the actual land elevation and to predict the future height of water logging in the study area. In 2000, 182418 hectares area was inundated by water and almost 50 percent of the study area is classified having high vulnerability. Saline line has entered upto 20 to 35 km into the mainland since 1967 which has great impact on agriculture and health. Many educational institutions of the study area are in vulnerable condition as some of them inundated completely or partially and even some of them are being used as shelter by local victimized due to water logged into their fragile houses. The largest mangrove forest of the world is also at risk to water logging and saline intrusion from the sea. 
To the Government of Bangladesh, NGOs, policymakers, planners and other interested parties it is important to measure and monitor present issues and to predict the future impacts of climate change. This will help to facilitate effective management and is particularly important where a lagre number of people are threatened. In this regard the present study is expected to be useful and will have strong implications in coastal planning and other climate change adaptation measures."

Climate Change (CC) and Armed Conflict (AC) studies are suffering from poor data

the gaps by taking the climate conflict analyses into a different scale (e.g., 55 km x 
55 km sub-national cell/year) and uses high resolution Geo-referenced data sets. This 
study presents the results from 10 years (1991-2000) of observations and a rigorous

occurrence in the Eastern Africa. The main objective of the study is to identify and 
understand the conflict dynamics, verify the pattern of conflict distribution, possible 
interaction between the conflict sites and the influence of climatic covariates of 
conflict outbreak. We have found that if the climate related anomaly increases, the 
probability of armed conflict outbreak also increases significantly. To identify the 
effect of climate change on armed conflict we have modeled the relationship between 
them, using different kinds of point process models and Spatial Autoregressive 
(SAR) Lag models for both spatial and spatio-temporal cases. In modelling, we have 
introduced one new climate indicator, termed as Weighted Anomaly Soil Water 
Index (WASWI), which is a dimensionless measure of the relative severity of soil 
water containment indicating in the form of surplus or deficit. In all the models the 
coefficients of WASWI were found negative and to be significant, predicting armed 
conflict at 0.05 level of significance for the whole period. The conflicts were found 
to be clustered up to 200 kilometers and the local level negative relationship between 
conflict and climate suggests that change in WASWI impacts changes in AC by - 
0.1981 or -0.1657. We have also found that the conflict in the own cell associated to 
a ( app. 0.7) increase in the probability of conflict occurances in the neighbouring 
cell and also to a (app. 0.6) increase of the following years (spatio-temporal). So, 
climate change indicators are a vital predictor of armed conflict and provides a 
proper predictive framework for conflict expectation. This study also provides a 
sound methodological framework for climate conflict research which encompasses 
two big approaches, point process modelling and lattice approach with careful

Yet, future projections regarding LULC change are missing. 
In this study, the CORINE Land Cover from 1990 to 2012 is used to perform change analysis. The Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network implement in the TerrSet GIS software is applied to model four scenarios for the year 2040: Business as Usual, Conservation of Agricultural and Forests areas and Renaturation with the assessment of impacts using landscape metrics. 
The results show a negative trend for ecosystem services in 2040 at different rates. A trend for the fragmentation of the landscape is found mainly in Renaturation scenario with 890 patches. A more significant decrease for biomass production in Scenario Renaturation and a loss of areas for food production of -32 km2 in Scenario Conservation of Forests. Recreational and cultural areas with a loss of -32 km2 in Scenario Business as Usual followed by Conservation of Forest with -29 km2.

Moreover, thanks to their built-in sensors, they can successfully determine the user  location, perceive the real-world and act upon those stimuli. In the previous years, a location-based and context-aware platform to support the treatment of patients with psychological disorders was developed at GEOTEC, a Spanish research group in Geospatial technologies. This platform consists of a mobile application that monitors the patient  behavior and delivers interventions, and a web-based application that allows therapists to define and steer the monitoring and intervention process. Concretely, the platform tracks the users location and visualizes it for the therapist. This thesis proposes an extension to the Symptoms platform, in two ways: to allow location- and time-based triggered questionnaires, to further assess the patients psychological state in-situ and in real time, and to extend the current location-based notifications system to use the same context  ùbased triggers to further assist psychotherapeutic interventions. To this aim, the Symptoms administration web application is extended to allow therapists to create extended context-based triggers (e.g., based on time/duration and location), to be used to trigger questionnaires (assessment) and notification (treatment). Furthermore, the web application is extended to collect, store and visualize the feedback sent by the patients to support therapists to make informed decisions. Next to the web application for therapists, the Symptoms mobile app is also extended to allow notifications and questionnaires to be displayed (when context conditions are met), and responded to by the patient. The proposed extensions are evaluated both technical and regarding usage (usefulness, usability). As a result, the mobile app and web-based application were found to be usable with SUS score of 86.75 and 75 respectively. The web app is found to be useful for the therapists to help assess and treat patients, and better understand patient  behavior."

RESTful API with a capability to retrieve spatial datasets easily from API level by querying 
in terms of parameters, namely Space, Time, and Theme. To achieve that we made two 
assumptions. Firstly, expressing the temporal parameter in a natural language (e.g. today, last 
year, etc) benefits the developers in many ways as it avoids having to deal with rigid date 
format. Secondly, if the API can accept parameters in any order, it saves the developers time 
as they don't have to spend extra time learning about the parameters order and they can 
simply focus on the main task. A user-study with 20 participants was done to evaluate the 
API in terms of its learnability. Half of the participants had prior experience of querying 
datasets from API level and remaining did not. The evaluation result was promising as both 
categories of participants found the API easily learnable. This means such API has the 
potential to restrain the problem of developers compulsion to spend a lot of time before 
becoming really productive. Likewise, it also had the potential to pave a way towards the 
next generation API as it addresses the problem of lacking refined APIs to access Open

Topics were geovisualized as interactive maps according to the probability of each spatial location word which contributed to the corresponding topic. This is analogous to thematic mapping in Geographical Information System.

Qualitative knowledge is relative knowledge where we obtain the knowledge on the basis of comparison of features with in the object domain rather then using some external scales. Reasoning is an intellectual facility by which, conclusions are drawn from premises and is present in our everyday interaction with the geographical world. The kind of reasoning that human being relies on is based on commonsense knowledge in everyday situations. During the last decades a multitude of formal calculi over spatial relations have been proposed by focusing on different aspects of space like topology, orientation and distance. 
Qualitative spatial reasoning engines like SparQ and GQR represents space and reasoning about the space based on qualitative spatial relations and bring qualitative reasoning closer to the geographic applications. Their relations and certain operations defined in qualitative calculi use to infer new knowledge on different aspects of space. 
Today GIS does not support common-sense reasoning due to limitation for how to formalize spatial inferences. It is important to focus on common sense geographic reasoning, reasoning as it is performed by human. Human perceive and represents geographic information qualitatively, the integration of reasoner with spatial application enables GIS users to represent and extract geographic information qualitatively using human understandable query language. 
In this thesis, I designed and developed common API framework using platform independent software like XML and JAVA that used to integrate qualitative spatial reasoning engines (SparQ) with GIS application. SparQ is set of modules that structured to provides different reasoning services. SparQ supports command line instructions and it has a specific syntax as set of commands. The developed API provides interface between GIS application and reasoning engine. It establishes connection with reasoner over TCP/IP, takes XML format queries as input from GIS application and converts into SparQ module specific syntax. Similarly it extracts given result, converts it into defined XML format and passes it to GIS application over the same TCP/IP connection. 
The most challenging part of thesis was SparQ syntax analysis for inputs and their outputs. Each module in Sparq takes module specific query syntax and generates results in multiple syntaxes like; error, simple result and result with comments. Reasoner supports both binary and ternary calculi. The input query syntax for binary-calculi is different for ternary-calculi in the terms of constraint-networks. Based on analysis I, identified commonalities between input query syntaxes for both binary and ternary calculi and designed XML structures for them. Similarly I generalized SparQ results into five major categories and designed XML structures. For ternary-calculi, I considered constraint-reasoning module and their specific operations and designed XML structure for both of their inputs and outputs."

With a use case in forest data models in Europe, interoperability of burned area data derived from Europe and Valencia Community in Spain were tested and analyzed on the syntactic, schematic and semantic level. We suggest approaches for achieving a higher chance of data interoperability to guide forest domain experts in forest fire analysis. For testing syntactic interoperability, a common platform in the context of formats and web services was examined. We found that establishing OGC standard web services in a combination with GIS software applications that support various formats and web services can increase the chance of achieving syntactic interoperability between multiple geospatial data derived from different sources. For testing schematic and semantic interoperability, the ontology-based schema mapping approach was taken to transform a regional data model to a European data model on the conceptual level. The Feature Manipulation Engine enabled various types of data transformation from source to target attributes to achieve schematic interoperability. Ontological modelling inProtÈgÈ helped identify a common concept between the source and target data models, especially in cases where matching attributes were not found at the schematic level. Establishment of the domain ontology was explored to reach common ground between application ontologies and achieve a higher level of semantic interoperability."

to forecast bike availability in station-based bike sharing systems. However, dockless 
bike sharing systems remain fairly unexplored in that sense, despite their rapid expansion 
over the world in recent years. To fill this gap, this thesis aims to develop a generally applicable 
methodology for bike availability forecasting in dockless bike sharing systems, that 
produces automated, fast and accurate forecasts. 
To balance speed and accuracy, an approach is taken in which the system area of a dockless 
bike sharing system is divided into spatially contiguous clusters that represent locations 
with the same temporal patterns in the historical data. Each cluster gets assigned a model 
point, for which an ARIMA(p,d,q) forecasting model is fitted to the deseasonalized data. 
Each individual forecast will inherit the structure and parameters of one of those pre-build 
models, rather than building a new model on its own. 
The proposed system was tested through a case study in San Francisco, California. The 
results showed that the proposed system outperforms simple baseline methods. However, 
they also highlighted the limited forecastability of dockless bike sharing data."

Cameroon comprises about 250 ethics different having different customary land tenure systems most of which have similar concepts and features. This thesis seeks to provide an overview of these standard systems and comparing it with the official land tenure system to understand where the systems counteract.

For indoor positioning different 
systems exist. But there is no general solution to fit all situations. A popular choice 
among service provider is BLE-based IPS. BLE-has low cost, low power consumption, 
and tit is are compatible with newer smartphones. These factors make it suitable for mass 
market applications with an estimated market of 10 billion USD by 2020. Although, BLEbased 
IPS have advantages over its counterparts, it has not solved the position accuracy 
problem yet. More research is needed to meet the position accuracy required for indoor 
LBS. In this thesis, two ways for accuracy improvement were tested i) a new algorithm for 
BLE-based IPS was proposed and ii) fusion of BLE position estimates with IMU position 
estimates was implemented. The first way exploits a concept from control survey called 
well-conditioned triangle. Theoretically, a well-conditioned triangle is an equilateral triangle 
but for in practice, triangles whose angles are greater than 30 ∞ and less than 120 ∞ 
are considered well-conditioned. Triangles which do not satisfy well-condition are illconditioned. 
An estimated position has the least error if the geometry from which it is estimated 
satisfy well-condition. Ill-conditioned triangle should not be used for position estimation. 
The proposed algorithm checked for well-condition among the closest detected 
beacons and output estimates only when the beacons geometry satisfied well-condition. 
The proposed algorithm was compared with weighted centroid (WC) algorithm. Proposed 
algorithm did not improve on the accuracy but the variance in error was highly reduced. 
The second way tested was fusion of BLE and IMU using K·lm·n filter. Fusion generally 
gives better results but a noteworthy result from fusion was that the position estimates 
during turns were accurate. When used separately, both BLE and IMU estimates showed 
errors in turns. Fusion with IMU improved the accuracy. More research is required to improve

However, due to limited research, little is known about the spatial patterns and correlated risk factors on the wards scale. In this research, we explored spatial patterns and evaluated related potential environmental risk factors in the distribution of malaria cases in Ethiopia in 2015 and 2016. Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) was used to assess the clustering patterns of the disease. The ordinary least square (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and semiparametric geographically weighted regression (s-GWR) models were compared to describe the spatial association of potential environmental risk factors with malaria cases. Our results revealed a heterogeneous and highly clustered distribution of malaria cases in Ethiopia during the study period. The s-GWR model best explained the spatial correlation of potential risk factors with malaria cases and was used to produce predictive maps. The GWR model revealed that the relationship between malaria cases and elevation, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) varied significantly among the wards. During the study period, the s-GWR model provided a similar conclusion, except in the case of NDVI in 2015, and elevation and temperature in 2016, which were found to have a global relationship with malaria cases. Hence, precipitation and relative humidity exhibited a varying relationship with malaria cases among the wards in both years. This finding could be used in the formulation and execution of evidence-based malaria control and management program to allocate scare resources locally at the wards level. Moreover, these study results provide a scientific basis for malaria researchers in the country."

However, it has not been missed by decision makers in the European Union (EU). There are laws to keep noise levels down, and schools are a target specifically mentioned in the European Environmental Noise Directive (END). Strategic noise mapping can identify problem areas and help evaluate situations. This thesis project explores and compares various approaches in an attempt to offer useful information to the noise mapping field based on the results of the analysis. The measurements used commonly in studies are taken by professionals using professional equipment. Either teams physically enter the environment to manually take measurements or they collect data wirelessly from fixed sensors. Both of these methods are expensive due to the manpower or equipment. In addition, these methods are limited in the number of measurements in space and time that they can represent. One option is to use citizens with smart phones to record noise measurements. Involving the public to gather information is commonly called crowdsourcing, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) or Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS). Three applications for Android smart phones were tested and compared to a certified, calibrated professional sound level meter. Also, mapping noise by taking sample noise measurements without also mapping noise sources may not provide the full picture. The second objective of this thesis was to apply sound attenuation and combination rules in ArcGIS to create a noise source map and compare the results to the common spatial interpolation methods. The comparisons of smart phone measurements with the professional sound level measurements revealed that they are not comparable quality. Each ANOVA and t-Test revealed statistically significant differences. This is mostly attributed to the phone  hardware, which varies between mobile device models and versions. The geostatistical interpolation tools delivered noise maps which had similar accuracy rates for predicting measurement points according to the cross validation methods used. The best (most accurate) prediction model was indeed the kriging method. The author successfully applied sound attenuation equations to create a multiple noise source propagation and combination interpolation toolset in ArcGIS. This can be used for an infinite number of noise sources. The fit of the actual measurement points in the noise source attenuation noise map was very similar although slightly higher than that of to the geostatistical methods."

The effects of the land cover changes have impacted on the stream flow of the watershed by changing the magnitude of surface runoff and ground water flow. This study is mainly focusing on the assessment of the impacts of the land cover changes on the stream flow by changing SURQ and GWQ for the wet months (June, July, August) and dry months (January, February, March) through satellite Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated with the SWAT model. ArcGIS used to generate land use and cover maps from Landsat TM and ETM+ acquired, respectively, in 1986 and 2001. The land cover maps were generated using the Maximum Likelihood Algorithm of Supervised Classification. The accuracy of the classified maps was assessed using Confusion Metrics. The result of this analysis showed that the cultivated land has expanded during the study period of 1986-2001. Using the two generated land cover maps, two SWAT models set up were run to evaluate the impacts the land use and cover changes on the stream flow of the study watershed. The performance of the SWAT model was evaluated through sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation. Ten flow parameters were identified to be sensitive for the stream flow of the study area and used for model calibration. The model calibration was carried out using observed stream flow data from 01 January 1987 to 31 December 1994 and a validation period from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2001. Both the calibration and validation results showed good match between measured and simulated stream flow data with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.93 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) of 0.95 for the calibration, and R2 of 0.91 and ENS of 0.90 of the validation period. The result of this analysis indicated that the mean monthly stream flow increased by 16.26m3/s for the wet months while for the dry months decreased by 5.41 m3/s. Generally, the analysis indicated that flow during the wet months has increased, while the flow during the dry months decreased. The SURQ increased, while GWQ decreased from 1986 to 2001 due to the increment of cultivated lands. The model results showed that the stream flow characteristics changed due to the land cover changes during the study period."

In these cases, where vegetation is spaced it is important to filter this noise. A Classification Model was developed with the objective of extracting just the vegetation  canopy data. The soil was filtered and the canopy data interpolated using spatial analysis tools. The final interpolated maps produced can provide meaningful information regarding the spatial variability and be used to support decision making, identifying critical areas to be intervened and managed, or be used as an input for Variable Rate Technology applications."

context and widening the semantic difference. The major challenge emerged with ubiquity of
geographic information, evolving geospatial technology and location-aware service is to deal
with the semantic interoperability. Although the use of ontology aims at capturing shared
conceptualization of geospatial information, human perception of world view is not
adequately addressed in geospatial ontology. This study proposes  Conservation GIS
Ontology  that comprises spatial knowledge of non-expert conservationists in the context of
Chitwan National Park, Nepal.
The discussion is presented in four parts: exploration of commonsense spatial knowledge
about conservation; development of conceptual ontology to conceptualize domain
knowledge; formal representation of conceptualization in Web Ontology Language (OWL);
and quality assessment of the ontology development tasks. Elicitation of commonsense
spatial knowledge is performed with the notion of cognitive view of semantic. Emphasis is
given to investigate the observation of wildlife movement and habitat change scenarios.
Conceptualization is carried out by providing the foundation of the top-level ontology-
 DOLCE  and geospatial ontologies. ProtÈgÈ 4.1 ontology editor is employed for ontology
engineering tasks. Quality assessment is accomplished based on the intrinsic approach of
ontology evaluation.
Results show that human perception and community narratives about conservation comprise
accumulated knowledge from everyday experiences but remain abstract with respect to
spatial and temporal representation. Foundations of domain ontology on top-level ontology
permit the establishment of the semantic connection between human perception of
conservation and existing models of geographic and temporal representation in the geospatial
domain. With the formal structuring of commonsense knowledge about conservation using
description logic, proposed ontology is capable to infer new knowledge based on the
conceptualized domain knowledge. "

Natural disasters such as earthquake, flood, landslide or man-made disaster such as fire, road accident can affect our life anytime. Many casualties occur during the disaster on the absence of preparedness and prevention measure. Lack of evacuation routes and the timely response to the injured people to the nearby emergency services is one of the main sources for a large number of casualties. Proper response operations must be carried out, as a slight delay can risk the lives of citizens. Since disaster cannot be mitigated, preventive measures before and after the disaster are important. Spatial data play a significant role in emergency management: preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. A suitable network analysis aids to a smooth network and especially helps during a disaster. 
In this paper, Castellon network dataset is developed using validated Voluntary Geographic Information. It is developed to find the fastest route to the emergency services, especially during or after the occurrence of a disaster. Data quality assurance is performed using positional, attribute and network length check to produce efficient results. The fastest and safest route to and from the emergency services are recognized to plan safety measure during the occurrence of a disaster. The evaluation of the network by participants provides insight into the quality and use of the network in a disaster scenario. It also reveals that VGI can be used further in the preparation of a disaster prevention system for various cities."

A biomass estimation model was built using on the ground measurements while GIS was used to generate biomass maps. The results from the model show that NDVI and tree heights were statistically significant explanatory variables for biomass in the Mixed Oak Forests of Davert, Germany. Estimates from UAS were the most accurate in terms of R2, compared to other sensor estimates from Sentinel 2, World View 3 and Orthophotos. Hence, two adjustment factors were proposed to improve the accuracy of World View 3 and Sentinel 2 estimates. UAS are thus a versatile sensor platform for biomass studies that complements satellite sensors to improve studies of global biomass of forests."

It is based on the Levels of Traffic Stress methodology and computed mainly with

in a city connects people with the places they want to go. For this research, the 
BNA open source tool is adapted to a European context to validate its ability of

destinations, and the overall score itself. They are related to cycling behaviors 
from two validation data sources: travel to work data in England and Wales, and 
crowdsourced bicycle trip routes in The Netherlands. The results indicate that 
in England and Wales, there is a significantly higher percentage of bicycle trips 
performed between origin-destination pairs with a low-stress connection between 
them. Additionally, a positive correlation is found between the percentage of bicycle 
trips within a city and its overall BNA score. In the Dutch case, the destinations core 
element is evaluated, determining that the destinations contemplated in the BNA 
score calculation are also among the highly frequented by cyclists. However, their 
importance within the score computation might require adjustments. Although a 
comprehensive validation cannot be achieved due to data limitations, evidence that 
providing low-stress connections between origins and destinations relates to bicycle

Since the 60s, the processing, analysis and visualization of cartographic data has been carried out using GIS as desktop software, installed on a single computer. The advantage of this system was the possibility of combining different cartographic information thereby facilitating decision-making.
The need to share data, mainly cartographic information, between agents who are working in the same area has been the basis for the creation of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) at global, national, regional ,local, or corporative level.
Several resources for managing, classifying, sharing, exchanging, combining and accessing geographic data through internet connection have been developed together with the implementation of all levels of SDI's. The resources can be classified as: software for publishing cartographic data (maps servers), publication standards, metadata, legal framework, agreements among organizations, and the possibility to create different user levels.Therefore, the aim will be to have cartographic information updated and available for all the involved agents who are working in the same territory, which will result in sharing efforts and costs.
Nevertheless, the development of new technologies has had an effect where the cartographic data producers have less direct contact with the field, ignoring somehow the people living in it who are the ones with best knowledge of the territory.
In remote areas, where it is difficult to access such as the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve Region (Honduras), it is indispensable to create an SDI for managing and sharing cartographic information by the involved agents in the territory.
It is important that the information offered by the indigenous communities is not left aside because they have a direct relation with the field. In the case of Rio Platano, they are scattered along the territory.
The basis of this thesis is to create the SDI for the Rio Platano region and the methodology to combine the different cartographic information published by different organisms. Also, it will be important to include in the SDI structure the information regarding the cadastral boundaries and socio environmental indicators obtained from the indigenous communities. It will require the design of participative pictograms using Participatory Mapping techniques."

Traditionally, the manual approach known as destructive sampling is the most accurate technique to estimate biomass. However, the large scales of modern agricultural research or production schemes are turning this approach into an impractical technique. Remote Sensing (RS) is a technology that has been applied to facilitate this task. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a popular RS tool for evaluating and understanding plant canopy structure due to its accuracy and ability to build 3D point clouds, but its high cost currently limits its application. Structure from Motion (SfM) is a low-cost alternative to LiDAR that involves acquiring images using a digital camera from multiple positions to generate a 3D point cloud similar to that which is produced with LiDAR. In this study, SfM point clouds derived from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) were used to build volumetric models evaluating and comparing two different methodologies for estimating plant biomass in maize (Zea mays L.); voxel-counting and convex-hull approach. The voxel-counting approach works by encapsulating the point cloud into volumetric pixels to generate a voxel grid. The volume is estimated by counting the number of voxels with at least one point inside. The convex-hull approach splits the point cloud into two parts and progressively calculate the extreme points to generate a polygon that encompasses the full point cloud. The result of this study showed that volumetric models based on SfM point cloud data are suitable for estimating maize biomass combining with volumetric models. Voxel-counting was more accurate predicting maize biomass (??2=0.973) than the convex-hull approach. SfM point cloud data coupled with the voxel-counting approach offers a low-cost alternative for providing accurate biomass estimations."

conclude that a decreasing diameter measure in response to BC based strategic node removal 
does not always show a robust network. Rather, the physical structural connectivity determines 
the robustness measure. In conclusion, greater than 88% of the network was vulnerable for both 
strategic and random node removal and were not able to be robust and resilient as well. Thus, 
this finding gives an ample understanding of the cities road network robustness and resilience.

However, many protected areas consist of private lands where agricultural activities have impacts on the conservation of biodiversity and habitats. The spread of large amounts of synthetic agrochemical products, and the consequent contamination of ecosystems, can reduce the biodiversity, triggering selection processes and creating resistant strains to those substances (ISPRA, 2015). 
The present work is based on an embraced methodology to evaluate the potential risk from the use of agrochemical products in Natura 2000 Sites of Community Importance (SCI) in Italy. The methodology is founded on a multi-criteria assessment of several variables, combined to generate a simulated risk index. The aim of the project is to develop a replicable geoprocessing workflow to generate the potential Risk Index for SCI in Italy. The use of GIS analysis is addressed to perform an integrated multi-criteria calculation of potential risk, based on the Preliminary Risk Assessment Model for the identification and assessment of problem areas for Soil contamination in Europe (PRA.MS methodology).

These ecosystems are designed to withstand the threat of natural hazards to protect inland areas. However, dynamic, and extreme climatic changes threaten to damage such areas, particularly in low-lying, small island states as Jamaica. With the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) method, areas of coastal exposure were identified and assessed using the InVEST Model. It was found that 23% of the coastline is highly exposed to climatic hazards across 177 communities. Validation of the model outputs with the Disaster Inventory DesInventar Database revealed that there was statistical evidence to state that significantly more frequent events causing damage and loss of life or property occurred in areas the model identified as highly exposed than in the less exposed areas. The island's socio-economic conditions at the parish level were analyzed with descriptive statistics to determine that 48% of the population has at least one unmet basic need, with the South to South-East parishes comparably more vulnerable due to the population size and exposure in coastal areas. Therefore, the findings of this assessment will be useful for disaster planning and coastal conservation and may be replicated in similar countries, especially surrounding islands towards a regional assessment. The creation of a combined coastal and social vulnerability index provides a balanced view of both major concerns on the susceptibility of populated coastal regions. This index is critical to the advancement of how we can comparatively quantify these characteristics and highlight areas for holistic improvement of lives, not addressing both concerns in isolation."

The study presented in this dissertation investigates the influence of landscape variation on the landform categories used by non-experts. Video-elicitation methods were used in interviews with inhabitants of two distinct landscape types, in Portugal. One study site was mountainous and topographically varied, while the other consisted of more homogenous, gently undulating terrain. Interview responses indicated that participants used more landform terms in descriptions of familiar landscapes. Specific place recognition was another stimulant for an increase in landform categorisation detail. Additionally, the participant group from the more homogeneous landscape had a smaller landform vocabulary, and primarily used variations on a core set of landform terms to describe topographic eminences. The other group had a much larger and more varied vocabulary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM)-based landform classification compared well with participant landform categories at a macro scale. A qualitative analysis of participant responses suggested that their drivers for categorisation are the salient features of the landscape (such as elevation and land cover), as well as utilitarian motivations (such as land-use, context and familiarity). This dissertation demonstrates the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool in the study of landscape in language. It also provides a contribution towards the development of formal landform concept representations in conceptual spaces and ontologies. "

An important source of uncertainty in GHG emissions estimates refers to land use changes (LUC) due to the complexity of the land system. As the land domain plays a relevant role in climate change mitigation, understanding the effects of uncertainty on projections of LUC-related GHG emissions estimates is crucial to better support the process of decision making. Based on a case study conducted by van der Hilst et al. (2018), this thesis evaluates the effects of uncertainty on the projections of LUC-related GHG emissions in Brazil towards 2030, given an expected increase in the global biofuel demand and distinct scenarios of LUC mitigation measures. With the use of Monte Carlo simulation technique, we developed a spatially explicit, stochastic model in Python programming language to perform the uncertainty analysis. As uncertainty can be derived from many sources, we focused on adding uncertainty in the model input data to assess its effects on the LUC-related GHG emissions estimates resulting from an increase in the global biofuel demand. As van der Hilst et al. (2018) performed an analysis of the same case study, but without uncertainty analysis, this thesis compares the stochastic results of the deterministic results. The comparison of the results obtained between the deterministic and the stochastic approach provides valuable insights about the effects of uncertainty in the final estimates of emissions. We run the model for six distinct LUC scenarios and computed the LUC-related GHG emission estimates given the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and biomass stocks, resulting in estimates with an associated uncertainty. We performed a statistical test to verify the existence of significant differences in the emission estimates between the scenarios and we run a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the contribution of the model components in the overall uncertainty of the emission estimates. The outcomes allows saying that adding uncertainty in the input data results in estimates with great uncertainty, specially in the emissions resulting from the changes in SOC stocks. The emission estimates obtained in this thesis have similar values when comparing to results of the deterministic approach of van der Hilst et al. (2018). The statistical test allows saying that the LUC-related GHG emission estimates resulting from an additional ethanol demand are significantly different between all scenarios, therefore the emission estimates could be used to support decision making e.g. to define or prioritize the implementation of a new LUC mitigation measure in Brazil."

Existing works have focused their attention on crops rather than forests. Adverse effects are felt by all flora and fauna but the impact of the recent droughts on forest ecosystems is still unknown. Greater root depth allows them to withstand the immediate impacts of drought in contrast to crops and other vegetation. This study aims to see not only the interaction between drought and forest vitality from a multi-scale and temporal viewpoint while also to detect the impact of the recent 2018/19 drought on forest vitality based on remote sensing data. The data from the German Drought Monitor was used for the area-wide estimation of drought in Germany. Vegetative indices like NDVI collected from MODIS and Sentinel 2A were used to study the interactions between drought and forest vitality. Data for both have been acquired for the years 2000-2019. A long-standing time series data was decomposed and seasonally adjusted for better cross-correlation between the variables. The cross-correlation was verified by using breakpoints estimation by dividing the data into historically observed and test data. The coniferous-dominated black forest was used as a study area for a more in-depth analysis. 
Results showed that forest vitality was lowest one month after a severe drought, indicated by the highest decline in NDVI for all the forest types. This was verified using high resolution Sentinel images and the highest change does correspond to the month of January 2019. There was change in NDVI of over -0.5 for 80.63% of the entire study area. The change for each forest type was 81.74%, 54.42%, 84.14% for coniferous, broadleaved and mixed forests respectively. Two decades of NDVI and Soil Moisture Index (SMI) data along with Sentinel images for better area calculation because of higher resolution make this a highly effective approach to assess the impacts of drought on forest dieback. The methodology and data can be applied across the study area and with suitable drought indices can be used to assess the drought induced forest dieback across the globe. However, in-situ analysis with ecological considerations at the individual level could further the validity of the cross-correlations among forest types and drought.

Crowd disasters have increased in frequency and intensity and have resulted in many casualties in recent years. These disasters can occur at different scenarios and are caused by a myriad of reasons. Over the years, the methods to study the evacuation behavior have evolved and evacuation models are extensively used. There are many kinds of models that are used, however there are many issues faced in the calibration of these models. The reason for the problems in calibration mostly stem from a scarcity of data related to evacuation behavior. It is difficult to conduct evacuation drills and gather data from actual evacuations. Virtual Reality (VR), in particular the IVE can help bridge this gap by allowing for systematic studies, that are safe, reliable and with high ecological validity to be conducted. To study the viability of IVE simulations for this, a user study was conducted to observe the evacuation behavior and see the impact of building familiarity and visibility on evacuation performance. The impact of building familiarity and visibility was studied on the Route Choice, Exit Choice, Decision Time, Total Evacuation Time and User errors. The results of the study showed that the evacuation performance increases with building familiarity and is reduced when the visibility is low, this is much more apparent when the users are not familiar with the building. The study also established the Route Choice as being the main contributing factor to the Total Evacuation Time and showed that in most of the cases (75% of the time) the people not familiar with the building chose familiar exits while the people familiar with the building chose emergency exits. The results of the study coincide with the existing literature and show that the use of IVE simulations is a viable method for studying evacuation behavior and calibration parameters for evacuation models."

This thesis aimed to identify and evaluate potential available areas in public locations for implementing urban agriculture practices within the urban perimeter of the city of Bogota in Colombia. The methodology was conducted using variables reflecting the physical, environmental and socioeconomic components of the area. Two approaches were implemented to evaluate a land suitability analysis for urban agriculture to alleviate urban poverty by increasing food security and nutrition in the study area. The first approach was based on expert knowledge combining GIS with multicriteria decision making analysis (MCDM) using analytical hierarchical process (AHP) method, estimating that 21% of the study area presents highly suitability conditions for implementing urban agriculture activities. The second approach was developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for classification models based on historical data of the current sites, where urban agriculture activities were being implemented in the city, showing that 18% of the study area is in high suitability conditions for the implementation of urban agriculture activities. Both approaches indicated that the areas of excellent suitability are located in the South and Southwestern parts of the study area, emphasizing its congruence with the areas with the lowest socioeconomic levels in the city. 
It was found that approximately 2% of the study area has available spaces in public locations with a significant potential for urban agriculture practices. Three projected scenarios were simulated where 10%, 30% and in the most utopic case 50% of these spaces would be used for urban agriculture activities and the vegetable productivity in tons of five of the most popular crops grown was estimated."

It is becoming increasingly more practical to examine a rock glacier with 3D visualization to have more perspectives and realistic terrain profiles. Recently gaining more attention is the use of Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) used separately and combined to gather high-resolution data for 3D analysis. This data is typically transformed into highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEM) where Differences of DEM (DoD) is used to track changes over time. This study compares these commonly used collection methods and analysis to a newly conceived multirotor UAS collection method and to a new point cloud Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M32C) change detection seen from recent studies. Data was collected of the Innere ÷lgrube Rock Glacier in Austria with a TLS in 2012 and with a multirotor UAS in 2019. It was found that oblique imagery with terrain height corrections, that creates perspectives similar to what the TLS provides, increased the completeness of data collection for a better reconstruction of a rock glacier in 3D. The new method improves the completeness of data by an average of at least 8.6%. Keeping the data as point clouds provided a much better representation of the terrain. When transforming point clouds into DEMs with common interpolations methods it was found that the average area of surface items could be exaggerated by 2.2 m^2 while point clouds were much more accurate with 0.3 m^2 of accuracy. DoD and M3C2 results were compared and it was found that DoD always provides a maximum increase of at least 1.1 m and decrease of 0.85 m more than M3C2 with larger standard deviation with similar mean values which could attributed to horizontal inaccuracies and smoothing of the interpolated data."

mapping and yield estimation are the two major aspects of crop monitoring that remain 
challenging due to the problem of timely and adequate data availability. Existing 
approaches rely on ground-surveys and traditional means which are time-consuming 
and costly. In this context, we introduce the use of freely available Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery 
with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution to classify crop and estimate 
its yield through a deep learning approach. In particular, this study uses patch-based 
2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to map rice crop and 
predict its yield in the Terai districts of Nepal. Firstly, the study reviews the existing 
state-of-art technologies in this field and selects suitable CNN architectures. Secondly, 
the selected architectures are implemented and trained using S2 imagery, groundtruth 
and auxiliary data in addition for yield estimation.We also introduce a variation 
in the chosen 3D CNN architecture to enhance its performance in estimating rice 
yield. The performance of the models is validated and then evaluated using performance 
metrics namely overall accuracy and F1-score for classification and Root Mean 
Squared Error (RMSE) for yield estimation. In consistency with the existing works, 
the results demonstrate recommendable performance of the models with remarkable

A mental health sensor-based software platform has been developed by the Geospatial Technologies research group (Geotec), consisting of an application generation framework that offers basic geospatial building blocks (location tracking, trajectory recording, geo-fencing), communication building blocks (notifications) and a basic visualization of collected data for therapists. The framework has been successfully tested for building an application to treat agoraphobia, addiction, and depression, using location-based notifications. However, defining the places of interest for a patient is addressed to a limited extent only. Thus, therapists have difficulties of identifying and defining multiple places of interest, and the generated apps were therefore mostly limited to single places of interest, which were manually defined. Hence, they are difficult to use in larger areas. This thesis aims to use a location-based service to support therapists in defining places of interest, based on location and place categories. The work is carried out as an extension of the SYMPTOMS platform, and it allows therapists to define multiple places of interest automatically and for larger areas. The added value of the approach (in terms of automation, ease of use, and universally usable of therapies) by the location-based services in improving mental health interventions is evaluated. As a result, the application was found to be usable with SUS score of 91.875 and useful for therapists to define multiple places of interest at the same time which simplifies the configuration process and makes therapies universally usable.

Several approaches have been developed to identify the bus data affected by bus stops. In this work, the effect on traffic monitoring of bus location data affected by a bus stop is tested through a case study in La Castellana, one of the main arteries of Madrid -the capital city of Spain-, by using data of its public urban transport company, the Empresa Municipal de Transportes (EMT). The analysis of the results concludes that the use of public bus fleet location data affected by bus stops has a bias effect on traffic monitoring.

The phenomenon of spread of infectious diseases is so complex 
that there are lots of uncertainties in the data and in the process itself. 
Machine learning methods like neural networks are useful in modeling 
this complex problem, however, these approaches lack handling 
of uncertainties. Similarly, it is seen in literature that a combined 
approach of neural networks and Bayesian inferences have not been 
explored much. Thus to fill these gaps this thesis aims to develop a 
combined model containing neural network method and Bayesian inference

diseases in areal units such as municipalities or health-zones. 
To introduce the impact of human movement on the spread of 
infectious disease, the movement data has been used combined with 
the daily infection data to form a spatial factor and used as a covariate 
in this study. In addition to this, the spatial correlation due to spatial 
neighborhood as well as the mobility is taken into account in the model 
along with the temporal dependencies. 
The model was evaluated on the COVID-19 dataset for 245 healthzones 
of the autonomous community of Castilla-Leon, Spain. The 
results show that the model is generally able to predict the number of 
cases of infectious diseases with good accuracy. Similarly, the mobility 
factor was also found to have an influence on the model. However, 
the flexibility of the model still needs to be evaluated by applying the

di erent strategies have been proposed to introduce space into the modelling and 
validation phases. Nevertheless, a comparison of these methods under di erent 
landscape autocorrelation ranges and sampling designs is still missing. This Master 
Thesis investigates under which scenarios spatially-explicit ML modelling and 
validation strategies are appropriate for spatial interpolation problems. 
We designed a framework that allowed us to simulate predictor and outcome spatial 
 elds with di erent autocorrelation ranges, as well as samples with di erent number 
of points and distributions. With these data, we tested di erent non-spatial and 
spatially-explicit (coordinates, EDF, RFsp) Random Forest ML models and evaluated 
them using the simulated surfaces as well as di erent standard (Leave-One- 
Out, LOO) and spatially-explicit (spatial bu er LOO, sbLOO) Cross-Validation 
(CV) strategies. We developed a new method called Nearest Distance Matching 
(NDM) to estimate the appropriate radius for sbLOO CV for spatial interpolation 
based on sample distribution and landscape range, and compared it to state-of-the 
art methods for radius search, only based on range. 
While for short ranges non-spatial models were superior to spatially-explicit models 
regardless of the sample size and distribution; for long ranges, spatial models performed 
better under regular and random sampling designs, but not clustered and 
non-uniform. CV results indicated that although LOO correctly estimated model 
performance under random designs, it yielded overestimated errors for regular samples 
and underestimated errors for clustered and non-uniform designs under long 
ranges. Results of sbLOO combined with NDM correctly addressed error underestimation 
of LOO in clustered and non-uniform samples, whereas sbLOO based solely 
on the range resulted in error overestimation for all designs under long ranges. 
This Master Thesis provides important insights to the  eld of predictive mapping: 
it elucidates in which cases spatially-explicit methods may be preferred, and establishes 
that state-of-the-art approaches for spatial CV designed to assess model 
transferability are not suited for spatial interpolation and proposes an alternative."

could result in a shift in their influence on land-use change. In land use 
studies so far, the focus has been on land-use change and not the state 
of the factors. Thus, this study focuses on the significance of drivers 
of land-use change between 1988   2009 in the Vietnamese Mekong 
delta. To assess how land-use change has been influenced by the shifts 
in environmental factors and the relationship between the observed 
shifts in influence and land-use change. The Vietnamese Mekong delta 
is one of the largest and most studied delta region in the world due 
to rapid increase in population and large-scale transformations driven 
by economic expansion in the last decades. 
Five land use types are considered in this study, these are; aquaculture, 
mixed crops, orchard, rice and urban. Each land use class was 
modelled using a logistic regression with the following environmental 
variables; compaction, elevation, population density, distance to river 
and sea, salinity and subsidence. The study period was divided into 
four; 1988   2006, 1988   1996, 1996 - 2006 and 2006   2009 to be 
able to observe a trend in land-use change. 
The findings of this study reveal that the significance of the selected 
environmental variables to land-use change is not constant over 
the study period. Some variables were not significant to land-use 
change in one or more periods, became significant in other periods or 
remained insignificant. The findings in this study provides decision 
makers with a better understanding on sustainable land-use planning

This study explored the efficacy of utilizing Mask RCNN, an instance segmentation deep neural network, in identifying multiple classes of trees within the same image. In line with the low-cost approach, Google Colaboratory was utilized which drastically lowers the training time necessary and alleviates the need for high GPU systems. The model was trained on imagery from three study areas which were representative of three distinct landscapes: very dense forest, moderately dense forest with overlapping canopies, and open forest. The results indicate decent performance in open forest landscapes where overlapping tree crowns is infrequent with mean Average Precision of 0.71. On the contrary, in a dense forest landscape with many interlocking tree crowns, a mean Average Precision of 0.43 is highly indicative of the model  poor performance in such environments. The trained network was also observed to have higher confidence scores of detected objects within the open forest study areas as opposed to dense forest."

Soil moisture assessments are important to understand the hydrological cycles and biophysical processes caused by global climate changes (Finn et al., 2011). Usually, soil moisture has been mapped with airborne microwave radiometers (Klemas et al., 2014) to measure the water retained in the spaces between soil particles. Its importance is due to the microorganism metabolic activity, regulation of the soil temperature and carriage of nutrients, among others. Soil moisture typically takes the form of small ice crystals, vapour, or small parts of liquid water in cold desert soils (Campbell & Claridge, 1982). 
Antarctic soils are composed by basically no organic and very low moisture content (Campbell and Claridge, 1987). Antarctica is a sensitive area to balance the global climate and its changes and its soil ecosystems are strongly regulated by variables of the abiotic environment and due to this, a research measures the incidence and spatial occurrence of the layer freezing to know how regional climate change could affect the energy exchange of this layer and its invertebrate communities (Wlostowski et al., 2017). Also, knowing how the dynamic of the surface varies in polar regions is transcendent to predict the impact of climate change in global sea-level rise in the future (Quincey & Luckman, 2009)."

provide meaningful insights into neurodegeneration by detecting the physiological 
manifestations in the brain caused by the disease processes. One field of extensive 
clinical use of MRI is the accurate and automated classification of neurodegenerative 
disorders. Most studies distinguish patients from healthy subjects or stages 
within the same disease. Such distinction does not mirror clinical practice, as a 
patient may not show all symptoms, especially if the disease is in an early stage, 
or show, due to comorbidities, other symptoms as well. Likewise, automated 
classifiers are partly suited for medical diagnosis since they cannot produce probabilistic 
predictions nor account for uncertainty. Also, existent studies ignore the 
spatial heterogeneity of the brain alterations caused by neurodegenerative processes. 
The spatial configuration of the neuronal loss is a characteristic hallmark 
for each disorder. To fill these gaps, this thesis aims to develop a classification 
technique that incorporates uncertainty and spatial information for distinguishing 
four neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer  disease, Mild cognitive impairment, 
Parkinson  disease and Multiple Sclerosis, and healthy subjects. This technique 
will produce automated, contingent, and accurate predictions to support clinical 
diagnosis. 
To quantify prediction uncertainty and improve classification accuracy, this study 
introduces a Bayesian neural network with a spatially informed input. A convolutional 
neural network (CNN) is developed to identify a neurodegenerative 
condition based on T1 weighted MRI scans from patients and healthy controls. 
Bayesian inference is incorporated into the CNN to measure uncertainty and produce 
probabilistic predictions. Also, a spatially informed MRI scan is added to 
the CNN to improve feature detection and classification accuracy. 
The Spatially informed Bayesian Neural Network (SBNN) proposed in this work 
demonstrates that classification accuracy can be increased up to 25% by including 
the spatially informed MRI scan. Furthermore, the SBNN provides robust 
probabilistic diagnosis that resembles clinical decision-making and accounts for 
atypical, numerous, and early presentations of neurodegenerative disorders."

The SDSS was then applied to a case study in Iowa, United States for the year 2013. Wind turbine and resource datasets were extracted from the U.S. Wind Turbine Database and WIND Toolkit, respectively. Resources were forecasted using Ordinary Kriging spatial interpolation and Weibull distribution modeling. Weibull parameters were estimated using the power density method. Wind power density, turbine rotor swept area, and the power coefficient were used to simulate power output and capacity factors of presently located wind turbines. Finally, alternative strategies for wind turbine development were ranked based on the estimated energy yields of presently located wind turbines.

Ground Biomass (AGB) and Carbon Sequestration (CS) in a subtropical forest. In the last 
decades, remote sensing-based studies on AGB have been widely investigated alongside 
with a variety of sensors, features and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Up-to-date 
and reliable mapping of such measures have been increasingly required by international 
commitments under the climate convention as well as by sustainable forest management 
practices. 
The proposed approach consists of 5 major steps: 1) generation of several Vegetation Indices 
(VI), biophysical parameters and texture measures; 2) feature selection with Mean 
Decrease in Impurity (MDI), Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA), L1 Regularization 
(LASSO), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA); 3) feature selection testing with 
k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), 
and Arti cial Neural Network (ANN); 4) hyper-parameters  ne-tuning with Grid Search, 
Random Search and Bayesian Optimization; and  nally, 5) model explanation with the 
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package, which to this day has not been investigated 
in the context of AGB mapping. 
The following results were obtained: 1) MDI was chosen as the best performing feature 
selection method by the XGB and the Deep Neural Network (DNN), MDA was chosen 
by the RF and the kNN, while LASSO was chosen by the Shallow Neural Network (SNN) 
and the Linear Neural Network (LNN); 2) before hyper-parameters optimization, the Deep 
Neural Network (DNN) yielded the best performance with a Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE) of 42.30 t=ha; 3) after hyper-parameters  ne-tuning with Bayesian Optimization, 
the XGB model yielded the best performance with a RMSE of 37.79 t=ha; 4) model 
explanation with SHAP allowed for a deeper understanding of the features impact on 
the model predictions. Finally, the predicted AGB throughout the study area showed 
an average value of 83 t=ha, ranging from 0 t=ha to 346.56 t=ha. The related CS was 
estimated by using a conversion factor of 0.47."

Trees contribute to thermal comfort within urban centers by lessening heat island effect and have a direct impact in the reduction of air pollution. However, mapping individual trees species normally involves time-consuming field work over large areas or image interpretation performed by specialists. The integration of airborne LiDAR data with high-spatial resolution and multispectral aerial image is an alternative and effective approach to differentiate tree species at the individual crown level. This thesis aims to investigate the potential of such remotely sensed data to discriminate 5 common urban tree species using traditional Machine Learning classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and k-Nearest Neighbors) in the tropical environment of Salvador, Brazil. Vegetation indices and texture information were extracted from multispectral imagery, and LiDAR-derived variables for tree crowns, were tested separately and combined to perform tree species classification applying three different classifiers. Random Forest outperformed the other two classifiers, reaching overall accuracy of 82.5% when using combined multispectral and LiDAR data. The results indicate that (1) given the similarity in spectral signature, multispectral data alone is not sufficient to distinguish tropical tree species (only k-NN classifier could detect all species); (2) height values and intensity of crown returns points were the most relevant LiDAR features, combination of both datasets improved accuracy up to 20%; (3) generation of canopy height model derived from LiDAR point cloud is an effective method to delineate individual tree crowns in a semi-automatic approach."

However, a reliable feature extraction method has not yet been developed with the desired accuracy and precision, and always seems to be a proportionality between the accuracy and the complexity of these developed methods. The aim of this study was therefore to develop an accurate road extraction method without compromising computational efficiency. In this paper, a semantic segmentation neural network that combines the strengths of transfer learning and U-net architecture is proposed with a minimal network complexity. Further, post-processing based on morphological operations and regional properties of the extracted segments were used to remove the noises from the final output. The results have been compared with different automatic classification and segmentation methods and the results of the proposed method produced an F1 score of 0.83 and high accuracy of 95.57%, more accurate and precise than all the other models for the freely available Massachusetts dataset.

DSM obtained from UAV provides an opportunity of including information

in countries like Nepal. While formal and informal settlements have similar 
texture, they differ significantly in height. In this regard, we propose segmentation 
of informal settlement of Nepal using UAV and normalized DSM, against 
traditional approach of orthophoto only or orthophoto and DSM. Absolute 
height, normalized DSM(nDSM) and vegetation index from visual band added 
to 8 bit RGB channels are used to locate informal settlements. Segmentation 
including nDSM resulted in 6 % increment in Intersection over Union for informal 
settlements. IoU of 85% for informal settlement is obtained using nDSM 
trained end to end on Resnet18 based Unet. Use of threshold value had same 
effect as using absolute height, meaning use of threshold does not alter result

better performance over model that trained height separately. Interestingly, 
benefits of vegetation index is limited to settlements with small huts partly

allow an IoT device to discover and communicate with another one to exchange 
services like humans do in their social network. Knowing the reputation of another 
device is important to consider if it will trust before establishing a new connection 
to avoid an unexpected behaviour. The reputation of a device can also be varied 
depending on its geographical location. Thus, this thesis proposed an architecture 
to manage reputation values of end devices in an IoT system, based on their located 
area. To avoid a hard workload of the system in the cloud layer, the proposed architecture 
follows the cloud-fog-edge concept by adding an intermediate layer called 
a fog layer. In this layer, multiple smaller devices are distributed, so it used the 
Blockchain technology to keep the reputation management to be consistent and 
fault-tolerant across di erent nodes in the layer. Ethereum, which is a Blockchain 
implementation, was used in this work to ease the management functionalities, because 
it allows the Blockchain network to run a decentralised application through 
the Smart Contracts. The location-based part of the system was done by storing 
geographical areas in the Smart Contracts, and make the reputation values to be 
subjected to di erent regions depending on device geographical location. To reduce 
the spatial computation complexity in the Smart Contracts, the geographical 
data are geocoded by either one of two di erent spatial indexing techniques called 
Geohash and S2. This work introduced three experiments to test the proposed architecture, 
to deploy the architecture in IoT devices, and to compare the two geocoding 
techniques in the Smart Contracts. It also additionally proposed a compression algorithm 
of the geocoded data. The results showed that the proposed architecture is 
able to serve the objective of managing the reputation values based on location in 
a decentralised way. The test case scenario also demonstrated that the IoT devices 
were able to work as a Blockchain node. They also were able to discover the service 
providers in an area and obtain their reputation values by querying through the fog 
layer. Lastly, the comparison experiment results showed that Geohash performed 
better inside the developed Smart Contracts, while S2 encoded the data much faster 
outside the Smart Contracts. The proposed compression algorithm of geocoded data 
resulted in a signi cant size reduction, but it was computationally heavier in the

intensity to be dependent on its spatial location has been termed as Contextual Contact 
Tracing. The results suggest that the Spatio-SIR model tends to perform more meaningful 
events concerned with the Susceptible population rather than events to the Infected or

This research developed a method to fill those gaps with user-defined options to balance processing time and accuracy of MODIS LST data. The presented method combined temporal and spatial interpolation, using the nearest MODIS Aqua/Terra scene for temporal interpolation, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) using 3-dimensional spatial trend surface, elevation, and aspect as covariates. The moving window size controls the number of filled pixels and the prediction accuracy in the temporal interpolation. A large moving window filled more pixels with less accuracy but improved the overall accuracy of the method. The developed method's performance validated and compared to Local Weighted Regression (LWR) using 14 images and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) interpolation by filling different sizes of artificial gaps 3%, 10%, and 25% of valid pixels.

In the first generations, the different specialists can interact more, but as the algorithm evolves, this level of interaction decreases. At a later point in the evolution process, controlled  through algorithm parameterisation, these interactions  can be eliminated. 
Thus, in the beginning of the algorithm there is more cooperation among specialists of different classes, favouring search space exploration. With elimination of cooperation, search space exploitation is favoured. 
In this work, different parameters of the proposed algorithm were tested using the Iris dataset from  the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results showed that cooperation among specialists of different classes helps  the improvement of classifiers specialised in classes that  are more difficult  to discriminate. Moreover, the independent evolution  of  specialist subpopulations further benefits the classifiers when they already achieved good performance.  
A combination of the two approaches seems to be beneficial when starting with subpopulations of differently performing classifiers. 
The PIC  GP  also  presented  great  performance  for  the more  complex Thyroid  and Yeast datasets  of  the same repository,  achieving  similar  accuracy  to  the  best  values  found  in literature for other MCC models."

In a previous contribution, the concepts of optimally aligned and optimally coplanar individuals were introduced, and it was shown that given optimally aligned, or optimally coplanar, individuals, it is possible to construct a globally optimal solution analytically. Consequently, genetic programming methods, aimed at searching for optimally aligned, or optimally coplanar, individuals were introduced. This paper critically discusses those methods, analyzing their major limitations and introduces a new genetic programming system aimed at overcoming those limitations. The presented experimental results, conducted on five real-life symbolic regression problems, show that the proposed algorithms  outperform not only the existing methods based on the concept of alignment in the error space, but also geometric semantic genetic programming and standard genetic programming."

A set of candidate solutions, called individuals, are let to evolve in iterative manner 
exposed to adaptation through simulation of natural selection mechanism. 
Genetic Programming (GP), is a supervised Machine Learning technique for automatic 
induction of computer programs from a set of training examples. Initializing 
the population is an important step for GP, and several strategies have been proposed 
so far. The issue is particularly important for Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming 
(GSGP), a sub-field of GP, where initialization is known to play a very important 
role. 
In this thesis, an initialization technique inspired by the biological phenomenon 
of demes despeciation is proposed, i.e. the combination of demes from previously distinct 
species into a new population. In synthesis, the initial population for GP, or its 
variant GSGP, can be created using individuals from a set of separate sub-populations, 
or demes, some of which run standard GP and the others GSGP evolutionary algorithm 
for few generations. GSGP with this novel initialization technique is shown to 
outperform GSGP using traditional Ramped Half-and-Half (RHH) algorithm on six 
complex symbolic regression applications. More specifically, on all studied problems, 
the proposed initialization technique allows to generate solutions with comparable 
or even better generalization ability, and of significantly smaller size than with RHH 
algorithm. 
Additionally, it is shown the practical application of the algorithm to solve a specific 
problem in context of an institutional collaboration with Casa dos Marcos, currently

As an art, it has mirrored its 
evolution and captured its thinking and creative process over the years. Given its 
importance and complexity, machine learning has long embraced the challenge of 
analyzing music, mainly through recommendation systems, classification and composition 
tasks. 
Current classification systems work on the base of feature extraction and analysis. 
The same applies for music classification algorithms, which require the formulation of 
characteristics of the songs. Such characteristics can be of varying degrees of complexity, 
from spectrogram analysis to simpler rhythmic and melodic features. However, 
finding characteristics to faithfully describe music is not only conceptually hard, but 
mainly too simplistic and restrictive given its complex nature. 
A new methodology for music classification systems is proposed in this thesis, 
which aims to show that the knowledge learned by state of the art composition systems 
can be used for classification, without need for direct feature extraction. 
Using an architecture of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long-short term 
memory cells (LSTMs) for the composition systems and implementing a voting scheme 
between them, the classification accuracy of the experiments between classes of the 
Nottingham dataset ranged between 60% and 95%. These results provide strong evidence 
that composition systems do indeed possess valuable information to distinguish 
between classes of music. They also prove that an alternative method to standard 
classification is possible, as classification targets are not directly used for training. 
Finally, the extent to which these results can be used for other applications is 
discussed, namely its added value to more complex classification systems, as well as 
to recommendation systems."

In 
order to reduce churn, the model will identify customers who may be thinking of ending their 
patronage. The model also seeks to identify the reasons behind the customers decision to leave, to 
enable the company to take appropriate counter measures. The company in question is an insurance 
company in Portugal, Tranquilidade, and this project will focus in particular on their vehicle insurance 
products. 
Customer churn will be calculated in relation to two insurance policies; the compulsory motor  (third 
party liability) policy and the optional Kasko  (first party liability) policy. This model will use 
information the company holds internally on their customers, as well as commercial, vehicle, policy 
details and external information (from census). 
The first step of the analysis was data pre-processing with data cleaning, transformation and reduction 
(especially, for redundancy); in particular, concept hierarchy generation was performed for nominal 
data. 
As the percentage of churn is not comparable with the active policy products, the dataset is 
unbalanced. In order to resolve this an under-sampling technique was used. To force the models to 
learn how to identify the churn cases, samples of the majority class were separated in such a way as 
to balance with the minority class. To prevent any loss of information, all the samples of the majority 
class were studied with the minority class. 
The predictive models used are generalized linear models, random forests and artificial neural 
networks, parameter tuning was also conducted. 
A further validation was also performed on a recent new sample, without any data leakage. 
In relation to compulsory motor  insurances, the recommended model is an artificial neural network. 
The model has a first layer of 15 neurons and a second layer of 4 neurons, with an AUC of 68.72%, a 
sensitivity of 33.14% and a precision of 27%. For the Kasko  insurances, the suggested model is a 
random forest with 325 decision trees with an AUC of 72.58%, a sensitivity of 36.85% and a precision 
of 31.70%. AUCs are aligned with other predictive churn model results, however, precision and 
sensitivity measures are worse than in telecommunication churn models , but comparable with 
insurance churn predictions. 
Not only do the models allow for the creation of a churn classification, but they are also able to give 
some insight about this phenomenon, and therefore provide useful information and data which the 
company can use and analyze in order to reduce the customer churn rate. However, there are some 
hidden factors that couldn t be accounted for with the information available, such as; competitors  
market and client interaction, if these could be integrated a better prediction could be achieved."

These results give the impression that almost all symbolic regression problems are 
easy for GSGP to solve. However, little to no research has been done towards GSGP 
hardness, while GP hardness has been researched quite extensively already. The lack 
of real life applications on which GSGP has more difficulty converging than GP creates 
a paradox: if there are no, or very little, problems that are GSGP hard, no research can 
be done towards it. In this paper we propose an algorithm that generates and evolves 
datasets on which GP outperforms GSGP, under the condition that the GP model remains 
as accurate as possible. The algorithm can also be altered so that it produces 
datasets in which GSGP outperforms GP. This allows for comparing GP hard datasets 
with GSGP hard datasets. The algorithm has shown to be able to produce favorable 
datasets for both GP and GSGP using multiple settings for the number of instances 
and the number of variables. Therefore, the algorithm proposed in this paper breaks 
the earlier mentioned paradox by producing GSGP hard datasets, thus allowing GSGP 
hardness to be effectively researched for the first time. Furthermore, tuning the algorithm 
led to some early observations about the relation between dataset composition 
and GP/GSGP performance. GSGP has difficulty converging when using only 1 dependent 
variable and 1 independent variable, while it is easy to produce datasets on 
which GP heavily outperforms GSGP with the same settings. GSGP performs better 
when more independent variables are added. Furthermore, a big range of the dataset 
has been shown to be beneficial for GP convergence, while a small range is beneficial 
for GSGP convergence."

Initially, extended literatures were reviewed in the field of data mining, crime analysis and crime data mining. Sentient provided 7 years of crime data which was aggregated on daily basis to create a univariate dataset. Also, an incidence type daily aggregation was done to create a multivariate dataset. The prediction length for each solution was 7 days. The experiments were divided into two major categories: Statistical models and neural network models. Neural networks outperformed statistical models for the crime data. 
This paper provides the overview of statistical models and neural network models used. A comparative study of all the models on similar dataset gives a clear picture of their performance on available data and generalization capability.

For recruiting companies such as Landing.Jobs it poses constraints on the ability to scale the business. Some systems have been built for assisting recruiters screening applications but they tend to overlook the challenges related with natural language. On the other side, most people nowadays specially in the IT-sector use the Internet to look for jobs, however, given the huge amount of job postings online, it can be complicated for a candidate to short-list the right ones for applying to. In this work we test a collection of Machine Learning algorithms and through the usage of cross-validation we calibrate the most important hyper-parameters of each algorithm. The learning algorithms attempt to learn what makes a successful match between candidate profile and job requirements using for training historical data of selected/reject applications in the screening phase. The features we use for building our models include the similarities between the job requirements and the candidate profile in dimensions such as skills, profession, location and a set of job features which intend to capture the experience level, salary expectations, among others. In a first set of experiments, our best results emerge from the application of the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm (also known as Feed-Forward Neural Networks). After this, we improve the skills-matching feature by applying techniques for semantically embedding required/offered skills in order to tackle problems such as synonyms and typos which artificially degrade the similarity between job profile and candidate profile and degrade the overall quality of the results. Through the usage of word2vec algorithm for embedding skills and Multilayer Perceptron to learn the overall matching we obtain our best results. We believe our results could be even further improved by extending the idea of semantic embedding to other features and by finding candidates with similar job preferences with the target candidate and building upon that a richer presentation of the candidate profile. We consider that the final model we present in this work can be deployed in production as a first-level tool for doing the heavy-lifting of screening all applications, then passing the top N matches for manual inspection. Also, the results of our model can be used to complement any recommendation system in place by simply running the model encoding the profile of all candidates in the database upon any new job opening and recommend the jobs to the candidates which yield higher matching probability."

be unable or unwilling to do so in the future. To improve this decision in the 
future, the integration of additional behavioural data into the credit decision is

FinTech firms are increasingly moving interactions between financial institutions

transformation enables companies to gather and analyze a large set of previously

outlines the key changes that impact the offering of credit products. Additionally, 
it presents the leading approaches of consumer credit research and leverages their 
best practices in the creation of a behavioural risk scoring model for a FinTech

The evaluation of the model shows that the inclusion of behavioural indicators

It is possible to measure quality of service by looking at objective network quality measures. However, a decrease in the quality of service will not translate into a bad quality of experience for all clients at all times. This is because a) if the client does not try to use the internet, he or she would not notice the deterioration of the service; and b) different clients have different needs in terms of service quality; a slight decrease in network quality maybe be noticed by an intensive user but not by a light user, even if the latter is using the internet. In the present report, we describe the work we have done to develop: a) a segmentation the clients according to their typical internet usage; b) a probability that a given client would use the internet at a given time. These two features were then fed to a classifier, along with the objective network quality measures.

This CLV model was limited to a 12-month future horizon, covered 7 company dimensions (one global, plus 1 per lines of business) and took into consideration as main future client interactions churn, cross-sell, upsell and risk of claiming. These previous components were modeled with the help of SAS Enterprise Miner or estimated using SAS Enterprise Guide and analyzing historical events.

little modifications have been done to the fully-connected layers at the end of the networks. In image classification, these neural network layers are responsible for creating
the final classification results based on the output of the last layer of high-level image
filters. Before the breakthrough of CNNs, these image filters were handcrafted, and
any classification algorithm was applied to their output. Because neural networks
use gradients to learn their weights subject to the classification error, fully-connected
neural networks are a natural choice for CNNs. But the question arises: Are fullyconnected layers in a CNN superior to other classification algorithms? After the network is trained, the approach is to benchmark diferent classification algorithms on CNNs by removing the existing fully-connected classifier. Thus, the flattened output
from the last convolutional layer is used as the input for multiple benchmark classification algorithms. To ensure the generalisability of the findings, numerous CNNs
are trained on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and a subset of ILSVRC-2012 with 100 classes.
The experimental results reveal that multiple classification algorithms are capable of
outperforming fully-connected neural networks in di?erent situations, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forests
and K-Nearest Neighbours. Furthermore, the superiority of individual classification
algorithms depends on the underlying CNN structure and the nature of the classification problem. For classification problems with multiple classes or for CNNs that
produce many high-level image features, other classification algorithms are likely to
perform better than fully-connected neural networks. It follows that it is advisable to
benchmark multiple classification algorithms on high-level image features produced
from the CNN layers to improve performance or model size."

Cell counting is a frequently needed task in several medical types of research, but often still made manually due to several constraints. The automation of this process can be challenging to achieve, especially when dealing with cell clumping and overlapping, and cells that can assume several shapes and sizes. However, doing this needed process manually turns out to be a bottleneck concerning speed during the research. As so, an automatic tool that allows researchers to quantify cells with different features in an accurate way is a long desired application in the medical community. In this thesis, a fine-tuned architecture based on Faster R-CNN object detection algorithm and Inception Resnet V2 feature extractor is proposed to deal with cell quantification in zebrafish xenografts, an innovative approach for the study of cancer, metastasis, and drug discovery, currently being applied at FundaÁ?o Champalimaud, worldwide reference in oncologic treatment innovation.

A model-ensemble is a combination of base learners used in different ways to solve 
a problem. The most common ensemble is the mean, where the base learners are combined 
in a linear fashion, all having the same weights. However, more sophisticated

GSGP is a variant of GP using different genetic operators. No previous research has 
been conducted to see if GSGP can perform better than GP in model-ensemble learning. 
The evolutionary process of GP and GSGP should allow us to learn about the strength

base-models used for this analysis were Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support

The attributes used in the modelling process cover 6 customer dimensions: demographic, 
customer profile, product profile, bank variables and usage as well as interaction with the 
company. 
The final model results calculated the Renewal Probabilities of every active policy. These 
calculations have been divided in deciles where the first group have the lowest Renewal 
Probability estimated and the last one has the highest Renewal Probability estimated. 
To determine the factor that affects the Renewal Rate the most, a comparison has been 
conducted between the first and the last group (low probability and high probability groups). 
Next steps for the project include, but are not limited to, making the results available to all 
stakeholders and the monitoring plan is also discussed."

we characterize different patterns of procurement activity among regional

However, Multidimensional Multiclass Genetic Programming (M2GP) and Multidimensional Multiclass Genetic Programming with Multidimensional Populations (M3GP), two wrapper-based GP classifiers, have shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers. 
The main focus of this work is a new version of M3GP, called Geometric Semantic In- spired M3GP (GSI-M3GP), inspired in geometric semantic operators. GSI-M3GP works in the same way as M3GP, but uses only three operators to create new individuals: add branch, remove branch and a new mutation operator called geometric semantic inspired mutation (gsimutation). 
In order to test GSI-M3GP and compare it to M3GP, an implementation in Java was developed.  
Nine different versions of GSI-M3GP were created and tested on eight benchmark problems. For most of the versions of GSI-M3GP, the new algorithm is competitive with M3GP on all the problems. Additionally, it was tested if adding a crossover operator would improve the results, which it did not. A few other alterations were made to the original M3GP algorithm to test the possibility of using the Euclidean distance, instead of the Mahalanobis distance, without harming the quality of the solutions. These alterations do not always maintain the quality of the solutions."

In this piece of work, three levels of personalized product rankings are proposed:

By evaluating the cluster-based and individualized prototype on a sampled data

The complex interactions and enterprise life cycle reminds the life of species in the nature and thus, the mimic of biological entities can be applied as a modelling tool for better understanding how company works and what makes it successful. 
The broad purpose of this work is to create foundation for applying Artificial Life simulation for business analysis. Artificial Life is a concept that allow to mimic biological evolution and behavior of living creatures for modelling complex systems, forming specific environment with interacting and evolving agents. Thus, the Artificial Life can be applied for the analysis of the enterprise on the competitive market for studying its success factors. Possible combination of factors and their value are company- specific and represent properties that affects performance of the organization. The enterprises can exchange their characteristics with others by means of stuff swap, consulting, merging etc., acquiring best practices and becoming more adapted for specific challenges. The main goal of this paper is the research and suggestion of such characteristics and their representation, which, by analogy with biology, will constitute Enterprise DNA. 
In this thesis the digital representation of the Enterprise DNA inspired by the biological notion of living organism  DNA is proposed. As the foundation of important company  features, the Enterprise Architecture concept was applied. Despite the fact, that it was previously used for an Information Technology architecture, this discipline was evolved to more broad science and became a tool for describing the business architecture of the company. The Zachman Enterprise Architecture framework used as a basis of enterprise representation. Regarding this tool, the artifacts for phenotype representation are proposed and then, their digital XML representation found. The DNA digital representation model (genotype) for artifacts is proposed, which can be used for further evaluation of fitness of the specific company to the competitive environment on the specific market. This representation can be used by means of Genetic Algorithm for further implementation of Artificial Life simulation on real company  data. The evaluation by the experts showed perspectivity of the idea of applying ALife modelling for solving business problems. As a result, some ideas for model improvement are discovered."

The recently proposed Neuroevolution algorithm called Semantic Learning Machine

Learning task where the error is measured as a distance to the known targets. 
The absence of local optima in the search space results in a more efficient learning

approaches of dynamically using the training data affect the generalization of the 
SLM algorithm. Results show that these methods can be useful in offering different 
alternatives to achieve a superior generalization. These approaches are evaluated experimentally

data sets, results show that the SLM is able to outperform the Multilayer Perceptron

tuning was applied to both algorithms. 
Furthermore, this work also considers how different ensemble construction methods

The main objective of this project was to build the models on the probability of having a claim within 
90 days from the start date of a policy in new business auto insurance. Also, the profiles of the riskiest 
clients were created, and further actions defined. A comparison of the models for claims that 
happened within 90 days and those that happened in the rest of the first annuity revealed some 
differences in characteristics of those clients/policies. The results were obtained by training four

Given the mandatory quarantines and mobility restrictions imposed in most countries 
worldwide due to the pandemic situation, companies had to adapt to the new conditions 
while keeping running their business. COVID-19 lead to a massive adoption of teleworking 
solutions. In most cases, the transition to teleworking occurred in a short time, even for 
individuals that had ever worked from home. The current study assesses job satisfaction 
drivers in a teleworking environment during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in Portugal. 
Design/methodology/approach: 
This study relies on the DeLoan & McLean theory of information systems success and 
Social Capital theory to shed light on job satisfaction drivers during COVID-19 times. We 
collected data through an electronic survey and obtained 173 complete responses. We used 
partial least squares structural equation modelling for the model evaluation. 
Findings: 
This study  main conclusion is that although social capital may be a fundamental driver 
for job satisfaction in the traditional environment, this is not the case on teleworking. Our 
study shows evidence that while the quality of information technology remains crucial, 
social capital dimensions are no longer relevant to the teleworking environment. 
Research limitations/implications: 
We acknowledge two main limitations: (1) The data was collected from a sample of 173 
individuals during COVID-19 times. Therefore, we should take a generalization of the 
findings with caution. Future research may test similar research models in different 
countries and more significant samples. Moreover, (2) the effects of social capital were not 
significant on job satisfaction in the short-term scenario. Future studies may evaluate 
whether social capital remains not relevant for job satisfaction in the long-term. 
Practical implications: 
The study shows evidence that the quality of information technology overpasses the 
importance of social capital dimensions. This is, social interaction, trust, and need for 
affiliation are no longer relevant for job satisfaction in a teleworking environment. This 
finding implies that -at least in the short term- companies could mainly aim to provide highquality 
information technologies to their employees rather than focus on social aspects to 
keep job satisfaction. 
Originality/value: 
This study fulfils the need for assessing the impact of information technology and social 
capital dimensions on the massively adopted teleworking environment during the COVID- 
19 pandemic crisis."

MOEA/D and GA have proven to be effective at finding portfolios. However, it

MOEA/D, and GA separately as optimization algorithms and Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM) and Mean-Variance Model as methods to evaluate portfolios. 
The proposed framework is able to produce weighted portfolios successfully. These 
generated portfolios were evaluated using a simulation with subsequent (unseen) 
prices of the assets included in the portfolio. The simulation was compared with 
well known portfolios in the same market and other market benchmarks (Security 
Market Line and Market Portfolio). 
The results obtained in this investigation exceeded expectation by creating 
portfolios that perform better than the market. CAPM and Mean-Variance Model, 
although they fail to model all the variables that affect the stock market, provide a 
simple valuation for assets and portfolios. MOEA/D using Differential Evolution

Work can still be done to accommodate more variables that can affect markets and 
portfolios, such as taxes, investment horizon and costs for transactions."

The Deep-SLM is a novel neuroevolution technique and functions as stochastic semantic hill-climbing algorithm searching over the space of CNN topologies and parameters. The geometric semantic properties of the Deep-SLM induce a unimodel error space and eliminate the existence of local optimal solutions. This makes the Deep-SLM potentially favorable in terms of search efficiency and effectiveness. 
This thesis provides an exploration of a variant of the Deep-SLM algorithm on the CIFAR-10 problem task, and a validation of its proof of concept. This specific variant only forms mutation node ! mutation node connections in the non-convolutional part of the constructed CNNs. Furthermore, a comparative study between the Deep-SLM and the Semantic Learning Machine (SLM) algorithms was conducted. It was observed that sparse connections can be an effective way to prevent overfitting. Additionally, it was shown that a single 2D convolution layer initialized with random weights does not result in well-generalizing features for the Deep-SLM directly, but, in combination with a 2D max-pooling down sampling layer, effective improvements in performance and generalization of the Deep-SLM could be achieved. These results constitute to the hypothesis that convolution and pooling layers can improve performance and generalization of the Deep-SLM, unless the components are properly optimized."

This project explores a Fault Prediction tool such as Survival Analysis. It undergoes 
the six phases of a Data Science Project following the CRISP-DM methodology. 
For applying the Survival Analysis technique (e.g. Kaplan-Meier), it is crucial to 
identify two key events using the equipment  historical data (e.g. STB): The beginning 
of the anomalous event and the exact moment of the fault event. Several techniques, 
such as Statistical Smoothing models and Anomaly Detection models, were analysed 
and compared in detail to detect the beginning of the device malfunction. The best 
results to detect the devices  anomalous event were employed by a Statistical technique, 
the SMA where the anomalous event is reaching 50 degrees for the one-day smooth 
average. 
Therefore, it is possible to obtain an acceptable anticipation period of 38 days for 
future equipment maintenance intervention. In this sense, employing a Predictive 
Maintenance solution guarantees the reduction of 71% of the actual emergency interventions. 
Consequently, the company saves more money rather than not making any

Sequential oligometastatic radio-ablation (SOMA) is a novel treatment method that aims at ablating reoccurring metastasis in a single session with a targeted high dose of radiation. To know if SOMA is the best possible treatment method for a patient, the benefits of each available therapy need to be understood and evaluated. 
The ability to model complex systems, such as cancer treatment, is the strength of machine learning techniques. These techniques have improved the understanding of numerous medical therapies already. In some cases, they can serve as medical support systems if they deliver reliable results that doctors can trust and understand. 
The results obtained from applying numerous machine learning techniques to the data of SOMA-treated patients show that there are favorable techniques in some cases. It was observed that the Random Forest algorithm proved superior at different classification tasks. Additionally, regression problems opposed a great challenge, as the amount of data is very limited. Finally, SHAP values - a novel machine learning interpretation technique   provided valuable insights into understanding the rationale of each algorithm. They proved that the machine learning algorithms could learn patterns aligned with the human intuition in the problems presented. 
SHAP values show great potential in bridging the gap between complex machine learning algorithms and their interpretability. They display how an algorithm learns from the data and derives results. This opens up exciting possibilities for applying machine learning algorithms in the real world."

It is one of the fastest-growing and most important areas of data science. Applications are endless, given various tasks that can be solved thanks to the advances in the computer vision field. Examples of types of tasks that can be solved thanks to computer vision models are: image analysis, object detection, image transformation, and image generation. Having that many applications is vital for providing models with the best possible performance. Although many years have passed since backpropagation was invented, it is still the most commonly used approach of training neural networks. A satisfactory performance can be achieved with this approach, but is it the best it can get? A fixed topology of a neural network that needs to be defined before any training begins seems to be a significant limitation as the performance of a network is highly dependent on the topology. Since there are no studies that would precisely guide scientists on selecting a proper network structure, the ability to adjust a topology to a problem seems highly promising. Initial ideas of the evolution of neural networks that involve heuristic search methods have provided encouragingly good results for the various reinforcement learning task. This thesis presents the initial experiments on the usage of a similar approach to solve image classification tasks. The new model called Deep Semantic Learning Machine is introduced with a new mutation method specially designed to solve computer vision problems. Deep Semantic Learning Machine allows a topology to evolve from a small network and adjust to a given problem. The initial results are pretty promising, especially in a training dataset. However, in this thesis Deep Semantic Learning Machine was developed only as proof of a concept and further improvements to the approach can be made."

give the ability to approach the problem with data from the   ùfuture  ù. The problem tackled in 
this work is the prediction of specific traffic patterns (namely traffic jams) for the city of Lisbon. 
Specifically, the question was to see if we can model the change in traffic after a road closure, 
such as for construction. This question is an interesting one as it explores a logistical problem that 
every driver and city planner has faced. Additionally while on the surface it seems focused on just 
traffic and city streets, general problems of path finding and global optimization are also explored. 
While there exist other software to simulate street traffic, none are very simple and require every 
location to be manually created for that particular software. The proposed solution is twofold. 
The first is to design a reproducible method for creating the agents from either existing data or 
from a set of rules that can be used to create agents where there is no existing data. The second 
is to design a simulation algorithm that can run off of an existing map, in this case open-source 
OpenStreetMap, such that the map can instantly be swapped with any other with no changes 
to the code required. By designing a simulation like this, the ability to simultaneously compare 
multiple modes of transportation can also be realized. The final results show that this project is 
successful as a way of seeing at least general trends as a result of a change in the road network (a 
road closure). While more work is needed to add multiple modes of transportation, the ability for 
the simulation to run on a different road network allows it to be easily extended in this area as well 
as other graph networks or flow simulations. While not perfect, simulations can be a significantly 
cheaper and safer option for analyzing changes to a network than actually making that change

The primary aim of this work is to develop a credit scoring model as a replacement for the pre risk check of the e-commerce risk management system risk solution services (rss). The pre risk check uses data of the order process and includes exclusion rules and a generic credit scoring model. The new model is supposed to work as a replacement for the whole pre risk check and has to be able to work in solitary and in unison with the rss main risk check. An application of Genetic Programming to credit scoring is presented. The model is developed on a real world data set provided by Arvato Financial Solutions. The data set contains order requests processed by rss. Results show that Genetic Programming outperforms the generic credit scoring model of the pre risk check in both classification accuracy and profit. Compared with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Boosted Trees,
Genetic Programming achieved a similar classificatory accuracy. Furthermore, the Genetic Programming model can be used in combination with the rss main risk check in order to create a model with higher discriminatory power than its individual models."

The Obstacle Tower environment aims to set a new Reinforcement Learning 
benchmark by challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents to traverse 3-Dimensional 
procedurally generated levels using a real-time 3-Dimensional physics system. The 
environment tests an agent  ability to generalize by requiring it to optimize aspects that are 
common in many Reinforcement Learning environments, but rarely combined in the same 
environment: vision, planning, and control. 
In this research, the original implementation of OpenAI  Evolution Strategies 
algorithm was applied for the first time to the Obstacle Tower environment to assess how well 
it performs in a more complex environment, where the agent  generalization ability is critical. 
Additionally, in the interest of exploring Evolution Strategies in this environment, common

improve the performance of the original Evolution Strategies implementation. Crossover 
techniques were not explored during this research, as they are rarely applied in Evolution

Such a tool will allow sites to take ownership of their responsibilities and drive their performance within the clinical trials, implementing measures to mitigate the risks. Aims: The main objectives of this research project are to 1) assess the current risk management methodologies used by Portuguese clinical research sites and 2) develop a tool that seeks to help clinical trials teams to prioritise their actions based on the most critical processes. Methodology: A survey, created to assess the risk management practices, was conducted among 46 Portuguese sites identified through RNEC and PtCRIN . Moreover, a risk management tool was developed based on Transcelerate's RACT and adapted to the operations under clinical research sites' scope. Results and Discussion: The surveys' answers show that, although 57% of sites affirmed to have a risk management tool, only nine sites (19.6%) have a structured tool or document to capture the analysis of risks systematically at the site level. A simple, dynamic and flexible risk management tool targeted to sites was developed. It is expected to facilitate risk identification and prioritisation according to its probability and impact. A detailed list of possible mitigations strategies was included in this tool. Conclusions: The developed tool's implementation may significantly impact the clinical trials? performance by supporting decision-making and promoting efficiency. This work intends to be a starting point to change the clinical trials' mindset by encouraging a more proactive role in managing the clinical trials operations at the site level and fostering the competitiveness of the Portuguese sites in attracting investment for clinical research."

Thus, biobanks and international networks play a strategic role in the development of biomedical research. In this context, sample and data sharing is as important as challenging. Besides many ethical and legal responsibilities, the major challenge of a biobank is its sustainability. Sample and data quality are directly related to a biobank's sustainability for which the development and implementation of internationally recognized standards (policies, procedures and processes) are crucial. IPO Lisboa, established in 1923, is the largest cancer hospital in Portugal and has a Tumour Biobank since 2009, requiring a general reassessment to determine its long-term sustainability and growth towards its mission: supporting oncology research. Based on the opinion of its collaborators (questionnaire), market competitive analysis and SWOT analysis, this work hereby presents: i) a proposal of strategic positioning (re)defining the vision, mission and values of the Tumour Biobank; ii) a (not for profit) business model clearly defining its value proposition; iii) a governance model with a substantial extension of its network of consultants along the whole chain of provision; and iv) a proposal of sustainability built on three pillars: organizational, financial and social levels. Taking advantage of the full institutional support, the first step will be the optimization of its current structure, organization and functioning with little capital investment. It is paramount to increase the effective access to the stored collections based on policies of justice, accountability, transparency, and proper monitoring to ensure trust and involvement of all stakeholders. By assuming a leadership position in the area, the elements of the Tumour Biobank of IPO Lisboa may promote public discussion as well as shape national law revision on biomedical research."

This growth has increased the need of having specialized professionals in the area, and this is how this Master (in Clinical Research Management) arises: to create specialized professionals in Clinical Research. The Master Program focuses on several areas of Clinical Research, like Coordination, Monitoring, Regulatory Affairs or Data Management. As the Clinical Research Coordination is the area of greatest personal interest, an opportunity arose to do an Internship at CUF Academic and Research Medical Center (at CUF Descobertas and CUF Infante Santo Hospitals), for 1 academic year. This Report describes the functions of a Clinical Research Coordinator in these CUF Hospitals, and which areas require more intervention by the Coordinator. Over these 6 months, it was proposed to develop a project: to create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) specific for Clinical Studies, that could be used in all CUF Group Hospitals, where applicable. SOPs are also presented in this Report. Concluding, this Internship (and also the Masters in Clinical Research Management) was highly enriching. It was possible to apply all the knowledge acquired in theory and it was a strong contribution to prepare for the professional world.

To corelate the PhD scholarships with the financial investment in clinical research, these scholarships were analyzed as an indicator of the investment on the researcher's academic education. Methods Information from two databases was analyzed and compared: a database of results for PhD scholarship's calls and a database for grants paid in the year following the award. After the crossing of both databases, we started to identify those scholarships whose project under development fits the concept of ""clinical study"" defined by the Portuguese law of clinical research n21/2014. Results The evaluation panels analyzed make up 12,82% of the total panels (5/39). They represent 27,52% of the total PhD scholarships awarded and 27,61% of the total investment. However, the analysis resulting from the identification of PhD scholarships that represent clinical studies shows a weight of only 2,3% compared to the total number of scholarships. The data obtained supports the idea that Portugal has an enormous potential to grow in this area. Conclusions The fragility of the data collected during the analysis may have led to less correct interpretations of the investment applied in clinical research.

Its notification allows the monitoring of safety and efficacy profile of medicines on the market, assessing the benefit-risk ratio. EudraVigilance (EV) is a system for the management and analysis of ADR information suspected of being related to authorized medicines or which are undergoing clinical trials in the European Economic Area (EEA), under the coordination of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The impact of ADRs on antibiotics is reinforced, in addition to the fact that they are sometimes nonjudicious administered, as in upper airway infections. Objectives: Through notifications submitted on the EV platform, analyse and characterize the ADR profile of the most consumed antibiotics in Portugal, prescribed for upper airway infections. Methods: Observational and retrospective analysis of the data. The variables were described and analyzed in an exploratory perspective, through absolute and relative frequencies, with emphasis on serious ADR. For the analysis of proportions, the chi-square test was used. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) was applied as disproportionality measure. A 95% confidence interval was assumed. Results: A total of 59022 notifications were analyzed, 64.4% were serious. In serious ADR, female sex (52.2%) and 18-64 age group (47.5%) prevail. Health professionals reported 87.8% of serious ADRs and EEA countries represent 50.8% of notifications. Skin and subcutaneous tissue connections (15,9%), general disorders and administrations site conditions (12,0%) e gastrointestinal disorders (9,8%) are the prevalent system organ classes. Death was the seriousness criteria of 4.5% of notifications. Conclusions: The identification of ADRs improves patient safety management, where pharmacovigilance plays an essential role."

After that and given the current interdependence and interconnection among the world's economies, Brexit represents another economic shock, with a global contagion effect, extending it beyond British borders. This document is intended to clarify the likely impact of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union in the Financial Markets Regulation and Supervision sector, taking into account the ""special status"" that the country has inside the common bloc and the particular characteristics that make the city the main financial center of Europe. The complexity of the subject and the slowness of the negotiation process have contributed to the successive postponements of the effective date of Brexit so that uncertainty still has a significant expression in the political discussion. Without exhausting the possible options for negotiating the exit agreement, three scenarios are presented which can be part of the final agreement along with the inevitable costs and potential benefits associated. As a result, none of the raw options - being part of the European Economic Area, negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with the EU or being subject to World Trade Organization laws - guarantee the same level of access to the single market as the one that the United Kingdom currently enjoys, nor even restores its full regulatory and economic sovereignty. The Brexit may have been the result of an old desire for the recovery of political independence, but perhaps it was only pointed as a momentary impetus that was miscalculated, since the result of a new referendum would be the opposite."

However, it has been subject to a lot of controversy over time, and a target of many criticisms, especially since the last financial crisis. While its legality, and even its morality is, many times, put into question, the truth is that short-selling poses very specific risks to the markets, and potentially very serious ones to financial stability. In European and North American markets, short-selling is comprehensively regulated, and the respective legal frameworks impose several restrictions to its practice. Both of these legal frameworks establish permanent restrictions, temporary restrictions, and even a set of transparency requirements directed at short position holders. This dissertation analyzes short-selling restrictions established in the European short-selling Regulation, and the North American legal framework. Although, in general, we consider that there is an equivalence between the sets of restrictions imposed by both legal frameworks, there are also some noticeable differences between them, many of which can be explained by the different experiences the European and North American markets went through over the course of the last financial crisis."

It is not analyzed, in particular, the title transfer financial collateral arrangement regulated by Directive 2002/47/EC transposed into Portuguese Law through Decree-Law 105/2004, of 8 May. The present text is divided into two parts. The first part has the main purpose of analyzing the contract of title transfer collateral arrangement seeking to discover the structural elements, determining the socio-economic function and, in the end, what is its legal nature (that is, the legal regime that is innate to the collateral when the parties do not stipulate otherwise). The second part seeks to answer the question underlying this thesis: whether the contract of title transfer collateral arrangement is admissible in the Portuguese legal order. The insertion of the contract within the legal framework of in rem collaterals entails the necessity of observing if the contract is in harmony with the principles and mandatory provisions which regulate the latter. Two questions have arisen that we considered pressing to examine the admissibility of the contract. Firstly, it was examined whether the rule that establishes the prohibition of lex commissoria (article 694) is violated because it describes and regards as null the pact by which the secured creditor appropriates the asset which is the object of the collateral with the default of the debtor. Secondly, there are no statutes that limit the scope of the effects to third parties from the establishment of a collateral through the disposal of an asset to the secured creditor. This circumstance creates a mechanism to the secured creditor to avoid collective insolvency proceedings, through foreclosure or appropriation of the underlying asset which is object of the collateral, taking priority over debts towards other creditors. It was asked whether this effect is allowed in the light of the principles of legal typology of priority titles over debtorís assets (article 604 (2)) and equal treatment of insolvency creditors (article 604 (1)). It was concluded that the contract is null since it violates the scope of lex commissoria (whose ratio includes pacto marciano), without prejudice to its conversion in cases where the necessary legal requirements are met."

The conclusions were based on the responses collected through a survey, which ìis a basic instrument of observation, in the survey and in the interview, allows observing the facts through the analysis that the respondent or interviewer makes of them (Ramos & Naranja, 2014)î , relying on closed questions, annual reports and the robust two-stage dynamic panel system to assess the degree of maturity of the Internal Banking Control System, which operate in the Angolan financial system. The results show that the degree of SCI maturity is at a low level for all Angolan banks, show that the existence of actual corruption actions is greater due to the lack of supervision and qualified resources. The sample for this study comes from banks traded in the Angolan market. In this sense, the results may not be generalized with banks traded in other financial markets. Due to the cross-border character of the internal banking control practices, our study suggests that Angolan banks strengthen the regulatory framework in order to be in alignment with national and international legislation, to have better control of potential events that may prevent the smooth functioning of the SCI."

Algorithms, just like a virus, can proliferate information on a massive scale and at a rapid pace that is difficult to control. Through a data sample, the algorithm trains itself to learn more and more from the information it receives and processes over time. Algorithms themselves develop and spread as quickly as it is necessary for a simple double-click on the Internet. Currently, there are still issues that bring barriers to the implementation of AI systems in the calculation of the insurance premium. These issues are mainly related to the data itself, the low representativeness in relation to the underlying reality, the choice of the model to be used and the characteristics/variables to be considered and, finally, to the level of supervision and human interpretation of algorithmic decisions. If these issues are not taken into account, each case which deviates from the algorithmic norm will be more difficult to assess and will consequently lead to a discriminatory decision or, in some cases, to the exclusion of the desired insurance cover. We are speaking about a sector that has already measures in place to mitigate discrimination, but for the time being provides now openness to non-compliance with its own standards by converting the use of its existing traditional methods to the use of AI. Given the direct impact of the insurance industry on our individual and collective lives, this is an activity that should be classified as high risk with the implementation of AI in its processes. Therefore, measures are needed to promote legal certainty in compliance with the current legislation, as well as the revision and/or creation of a legislative framework to control the risk of proliferation of discrimination practices prohibited by the industry. In order to avoid discriminatory results in machine learning systems in the calculation of the insurance premium, it is important to identify bias included in the dataset, to audit the models used and existing software, as well as a full understanding of machine learning decisions in order to have a commercially reliable AI from the user's point of view, which is legally secure and ethically acceptable."

In turn, taxes constitute a financial, coercive and unilateral provision, required by a public entity for the purpose of raising revenue for the State.

We found that, in general, in comparison with the IMD, the new IDD places stricter requirements that banks must comply with. The IDD tightens the activities of insurance distribution through banks by prohibiting banks distributing insurance products under the form of tied or ancillary insurance intermediaries. Under the new IDD, banks are now considered as insurance intermediaries and must comply fully important IDDís requirements, including: (i) conducting at least 15 hours of professional training per year for their employees, (ii) disclosing customers with information concerning remuneration in relation to insurance contracts, (iii) conducting requirements of product oversight and governance, in particular, banks must maintain and arrange whether a products oversight and governance policy or insurance distribution arrangements in order to ensure that their insurance products or their insurance distribution will meet the best interest of customers, and (iv) in the case of cross-selling, banks must specify the demands and needs of customers in relation to insurance products, and offering customers the ability of buying insurance products and other products separately.

The main purpose is to bring reflections about the way that it fits with the Brazilian reality, considering all its dramatic aspects, such as economic and political crisis, corruption scandals, etc. The work is divided into three chapters, the first presenting D&O insurance in a generic way, demonstrating its main characteristics, its importance and the way it works. In the second chapter, we started to enter the Brazilian reality by presenting the way the Brazilian administration is organized and the risks to which Brazilian administrators are exposed. In the third chapter, we present the way in which the insurance in question is applied in practice, demonstrating how the operations to combat corruption in the country influenced the number of contracts as well as its forms."
