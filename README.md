# NETWORK-TD-SOM-Network and SOM of document topics
### Case study: Master’s theses from NOVA IMS
 
# ABSTRACT
Digital libraries are innovative technologies for knowledge sharing. Endless quantities of documents/information are accessed through them. However, the efficiency of documents/information search systems and their ability to identify the desired and related information are not keeping pace with the ever-increasing volume of stored data. Here we present Network TD-SOM, a systematic process that offers a practical method of searching, visualising, organising, discovering related documents, and extracting knowledge from a vast corpus. It combines different topic modelling algorithms implemented separately with a two-level hybrid clustering approach and network analysis. In each technique, we exploit the results to design various kinds of spatialisation dedicated to different purposes. For example, some allow the uncovering of the thematic structure distribution over time and profiling of the clusters in a corpus. The main visualisation is an interactive corpus network that supports exploration, browsing, navigation, and zoom. Additionally, it allows incorporating the main results of each technique used and the useful metadata information into the visualisation. We evaluated the Network TD-SOM performance on the Master’s theses dataset from NOVA IMS. LDA and BERTopic successfully uncovered the thematic structure and extracted helpful knowledge of the dataset. However, BERTopic demonstrated superiority as a solution. The features/topics extracted from BERTopic also leverage the cluster results compared with the features from LDA. The arrangement of the two network theses had similarities with the cluster results. However, the one modelled by using features/topics from LDA was better than the BERTopic.
